This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration.

* What the .el

If you are wondering where has gone all of the Lisp, fear not, for it is
automagically tangled from an Org file into a Lisp file.

* Installation

** Dependencies

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Tested on macOS only.

I trust your Google-fu to make the most of the below instructions.
#+END_QUOTE

| =jansson=  | Enable native JSON parsing              |
| =libvterm= | Used by terminal emulation within Emacs |
| =pinentry= | Let Emacs prompt for passphrases        |
| =ripgrep=  | Prefer =rg= over =grep=                 |

** Emacs

*** Manjaro

See [[./MANJARO.org][MANJARO]].

*** MacOS

Install Emacs 27 or above. I prefer
[[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][ =emacs-plus= ]] for its
additional compilation flags, specifically the ability not to have a title bar
ie. fake fullscreen since it has its downsides on macOS.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus@28 --with-no-titlebar
#+END_SRC

Clone the repository into your user directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs.git ~/.config/emacs/
#+END_SRC

** Flycheck

I use =flycheck= as linter framework to display syntax warnings and errors
within each buffer. It is recommended to have your linting dependencies
version-controlled next to your code. Assuming that's correctly set up, Emacs
will find them automatically so that your linting corresponds to that of your
team.

However, if you needed linting feedback outside of a collaborative project, you
would need to install the following dependencies globally.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm install -g eslint                   # JavaScript
npm install -g jsonlint                 # JSON
npm install -g stylelint                # SCSS
#+END_SRC

** Icons

The mode-line utilizes features from =all-the-icons=.

Run the following when Emacs starts for the first time in order to download the
required fonts.

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts RET
#+END_SRC

** LSP

In order for Emacs to connect to the LSP servers, install the language-specific
dependencies.

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x lsp-install-server RET eslint RET
M-x lsp-install-server RET ts-ls RET
#+END_SRC
