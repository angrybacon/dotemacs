1 Introduction
**************

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as
an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.  While
we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each and every
Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced Git users
to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks directly from
within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only Magit and Git
itself deserve to be called porcelains.

   Staging and otherwise applying changes is one of the most important
features in a Git porcelain and here Magit outshines anything else,
including Git itself.  Git’s own staging interface (‘git add --patch’)
is so cumbersome that many users only use it in exceptional cases.  In
Magit staging a hunk or even just part of a hunk is as trivial as
staging all changes made to a file.

   The most visible part of Magit’s interface is the status buffer,
which displays information about the current repository.  Its content is
created by running several Git commands and making their output
actionable.  Among other things, it displays information about the
current branch, lists unpulled and unpushed changes and contains
sections displaying the staged and unstaged changes.  That might sound
noisy, but, since sections are collapsible, it’s not.

   To stage or unstage a change one places the cursor on the change and
then types ‘s’ or ‘u’.  The change can be a file or a hunk, or when the
region is active (i.e.  when there is a selection) several files or
hunks, or even just part of a hunk.  The change or changes that these
commands - and many others - would act on are highlighted.

   Magit also implements several other "apply variants" in addition to
staging and unstaging.  One can discard or reverse a change, or apply it
to the working tree.  Git’s own porcelain only supports this for staging
and unstaging and you would have to do something like ‘git diff ... |
??? | git apply ...’ to discard, revert, or apply a single hunk on the
command line.  In fact that’s exactly what Magit does internally (which
is what lead to the term "apply variants").

   Magit isn’t just for Git experts, but it does assume some prior
experience with Git as well as Emacs.  That being said, many users have
reported that using Magit was what finally taught them what Git is
capable of and how to use it to its fullest.  Other users wished they
had switched to Emacs sooner so that they would have gotten their hands
on Magit earlier.

   While one has to know the basic features of Emacs to be able to make
full use of Magit, acquiring just enough Emacs skills doesn’t take long
and is worth it, even for users who prefer other editors.  Vim users are
advised to give Evil (https://bitbucket.org/lyro/evil/wiki/Home), the
"Extensible VI Layer for Emacs", and Spacemacs
(https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs), an "Emacs starter-kit focused
on Evil" a try.

   Magit provides a consistent and efficient Git porcelain.  After a
short learning period, you will be able to perform most of your daily
version control tasks faster than you would on the command line.  You
will likely also start using features that seemed too daunting in the
past.

   Magit fully embraces Git.  It exposes many advanced features using a
simple but flexible interface instead of only wrapping the trivial ones
like many GUI clients do.  Of course Magit supports logging, cloning,
pushing, and other commands that usually don’t fail in spectacular ways;
but it also supports tasks that often cannot be completed in a single
step.  Magit fully supports tasks such as merging, rebasing,
cherry-picking, reverting, and blaming by not only providing a command
to initiate these tasks but also by displaying context sensitive
information along the way and providing commands that are useful for
resolving conflicts and resuming the sequence after doing so.

   Magit wraps and in many cases improves upon at least the following
Git porcelain commands: ‘add’, ‘am’, ‘bisect’, ‘blame’, ‘branch’,
‘checkout’, ‘cherry’, ‘cherry-pick’, ‘clean’, ‘clone’, ‘commit’,
‘config’, ‘describe’, ‘diff’, ‘fetch’, ‘format-patch’, ‘init’, ‘log’,
‘merge’, ‘merge-tree’, ‘mv’, ‘notes’, ‘pull’, ‘rebase’, ‘reflog’,
‘remote’, ‘request-pull’, ‘reset’, ‘revert’, ‘rm’, ‘show’, ‘stash’,
‘submodule’, and ‘tag’.  Many more Magit porcelain commands are
implemented on top of Git plumbing commands.

2 Installation
**************

Magit can be installed using Emacs’ package manager or manually from its
development repository.

* Menu:

* Updating from an older release::
* Installing from an Elpa archive::
* Installing from the Git repository::
* Post-installation tasks::


File: magit.info,  Node: Updating from an older release,  Next: Installing from an Elpa archive,  Up: Installation

2.1 Updating from an older release
==================================

When updating from ‘1.2.*’ or ‘1.4.*’, you should first uninstall Magit
and some of its dependencies and restart Emacs before installing the
latest release.

   • The old Magit installation has to be removed because some macros
     have changed and using the old definitions when building the new
     release would lead to very strange results, including compile
     errors.  This is due to a limitation in Emacs’ package manager or
     rather Emacs itself: it’s not possible to reliably unload a feature
     or even all features belonging to a package.

   • Furthermore the old dependencies ‘git-commit-mode’ and
     ‘git-rebase-mode’ have to be removed because they are no longer
     used by the ‘2.1.0’ release and later, and get in the way of their
     successors ‘git-commit’ and ‘git-rebase’.

   So please uninstall the packages ‘magit’, ‘git-commit-mode’, and
‘git-rebase-mode’.  Then quit Emacs and start a new instance.  Only then
follow the instructions in either one of the next two sections.

   Also note that starting with the ‘2.1.0’ release, Magit requires at
least Emacs ‘24.4’ and Git ‘1.9.4’.  You should make sure you have at
least these releases installed before updating Magit.  And if you
connect to remote hosts using Tramp, then you should also make sure to
install a recent enough Git version on these hosts.


File: magit.info,  Node: Installing from an Elpa archive,  Next: Installing from the Git repository,  Prev: Updating from an older release,  Up: Installation

2.2 Installing from an Elpa archive
===================================

If you are updating from a release older than ‘2.1.0’, then you have to
first uninstall the old version.  See *note Updating from an older
release: Updating from an older release.

   Magit is available from all three of the popular unofficial Elpa
archives: Melpa, Melpa-Stable, and Marmalade.  If you haven’t used
Emacs’ package manager before, then it is high time you familiarize
yourself with it by reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see
*note (emacs)Packages::.  Then add one of the archives to
‘package-archives’:

   • To use Melpa:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

   • To use Melpa-Stable:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)

   • To use Marmalade:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") t)

   Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using:

     M-x package-refresh-contents RET

   Once you have done that, you can install Magit and its dependencies
using:

     M-x package-install RET magit RET

   Now see *note Post-installation tasks: Post-installation tasks.


File: magit.info,  Node: Installing from the Git repository,  Next: Post-installation tasks,  Prev: Installing from an Elpa archive,  Up: Installation

2.3 Installing from the Git repository
======================================

If you are updating from a release older than ‘2.1.0’, then you have to
first uninstall the old version.  See *note Updating from an older
release: Updating from an older release.

   Magit depends on the ‘dash’ library, available from all three of the
popular third-party Elpa archives.  Install it using ‘M-x
package-install RET dash RET’.  Of course you may also install it
manually from its development repository, but I won’t cover that here.

   Then clone the Magit repository:

     $ git clone git://github.com/magit/magit.git ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit
     $ cd ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit

   Then compile the libraries and generate the info manuals:

     $ make

   If you haven’t installed ‘dash’ using Elpa or at
‘/path/to/magit/../dash’, then you have to tell ‘make’ where to find it.
To do so create ‘/path/to/magit/config.mk’ with the following content
before running ‘make’:

     LOAD_PATH = -L /path/to/magit/lisp -L /path/to/dash

   Finally add this to your init file:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit/lisp")
     (require 'magit)

     (with-eval-after-load 'info
       (info-initialize)
       (add-to-list 'Info-directory-list
                    "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit/Documentation/"))

   Note that you have to add the ‘lisp/’ subdirectory to the
‘load-path’, not the top-level of the repository.

   Instead of requiring the feature ‘magit’, you could only load the
autoloads, by loading the file ‘magit-autoloads.el’.

   Instead of running Magit directly from the repository by adding that
to the ‘load-path’, you might want to instead install it in some other
directory using ‘sudo make install’ and setting ‘load-path’ accordingly.

   To update Magit use:

     $ git pull
     $ make

   At times it might be necessary to run ‘make clean all’ instead.

   To view all available targets use ‘make help’.

   Now see *note Post-installation tasks: Post-installation tasks.


File: magit.info,  Node: Post-installation tasks,  Prev: Installing from the Git repository,  Up: Installation

2.4 Post-installation tasks
===========================

After installing Magit you should verify that you are indeed using the
Magit, Git, and Emacs releases you think you are using.  It’s best to
restart Emacs before doing so, to make sure you are not using an
outdated value for ‘load-path’.

     M-x magit-version RET

   should display something like

     Magit 2.2.0, Git 2.4.2, Emacs 24.5.1

   Then you might also want to read about options that many users likely
want to customize.  See *note Essential settings: Essential settings.

   To be able to follow cross references to Git manpages found in this
manual, you might also have to manually install the ‘gitman’ info
manual, or advice ‘Info-follow-nearest-node’ to instead open the actual
manpage.  See *note How to install the gitman info manual?: How to
install the gitman info manual?.

   If you are completely new to Magit then see *note Getting started:
Getting started.

   If you have used an older Magit release before, then you should have
a look at the release notes
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magit/magit/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.1.0.txt>
and
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magit/magit/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.2.0.txt>

   And last but not least please consider making a donation, to ensure
that I can keep working on Magit.  See <http://magit.vc/donations.html>
for various donation options.

3 Getting started
*****************

This section describes the most essential features that many Magitians
use on a daily basis.  It only scratches the surface but should be
enough to get you started.

   (You might want to create a repository just for this walk-through,
e.g.  by cloning an existing repository.  If you don’t use a separate
repository then make sure you create a snapshot as described below).

   To display information about the current Git repository, type ‘M-x
magit-status’.  You will be doing that so often that it is best to bind
this command globally:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x g") 'magit-status)

   Most Magit commands are commonly invoked from this buffer.  It should
be considered the primary interface to interact with Git using Magit.
There are many other Magit buffers, but they are usually created from
this buffer.

   Depending on what state your repository is in, this buffer will
contain sections titled "Staged changes", "Unstaged changes", "Unpulled
commits", "Unpushed commits", and/or some others.

   If some staged and/or unstaged changes exist, you should back them up
now.  Type ‘z’ to show the stashing popup buffer featuring various stash
variants and arguments that can be passed to these commands.  Do not
worry about those for now, just type ‘Z’ (uppercase) to create a stash
while also keeping the index and work tree intact.  The status buffer
should now also contain a section titled "Stashes".

   Otherwise, if there are no uncommitted changes, you should create
some now by editing and saving some of the tracked files.  Then go back
to the status buffer, while at the same time refreshing it, by typing
‘C-x g’.  (When the status buffer, or any Magit buffer for that matter,
is the current buffer, then you can also use just ‘g’ to refresh it).

   Move between sections using ‘p’ and ‘n’.  Note that the bodies of
some sections are hidden.  Type ‘TAB’ to expand or collapse the section
at point.  You can also use ‘C-tab’ to cycle the visibility of the
current section and its children.  Move to a file section inside the
section named "Unstaged changes" and type ‘s’ to stage the changes you
have made to that file.  That file now appears under "Staged changes".

   Magit can stage and unstage individual hunks, not just complete
files.  Move to the file you have just staged, expand it using ‘TAB’,
move to one of the hunks using ‘n’, and unstage just that by typing ‘u’.
Note how the staging (‘s’) and unstaging (‘u’) commands operate on the
change at point.  Many other commands behave the same way.

   You can also un-/stage just part of a hunk.  Inside the body of a
hunk section (move there using ‘C-n’), set the mark using ‘C-SPC’ and
move down until some added and removed lines fall inside the region but
not all of them.  Again type ‘s’ to stage.

   It’s also possible to un-/stage multiple files at once.  Move to a
file section, type ‘C-SPC’, move to the next file using ‘n’, and then
‘s’ to stage both files.  Note that both the mark and point have to be
on the headings of sibling sections for this to work.  If the region
looks like it does in other buffers, then it doesn’t select Magit
sections that can be acted on as a unit.

   And then of course you want to commit your changes.  Type ‘c’.  This
shows the committing popup buffer featuring various commit variants and
arguments that can be passed to ‘git commit’.  Do not worry about those
for now.  We want to create a "normal" commit, which is done by typing
‘c’ again.

   Now two new buffers appear.  One is for writing the commit message,
the other shows a diff with the changes that are about to committed.
Write a message and then type ‘C-c C-c’ to actually create the commit.

   You probably don’t want to push the commit you just created because
you just committed some random changes, but if that is not the case you
could push it by typing ‘P’ to bring up the push popup and then ‘P’
again to push to the configured upstream.  (If the upstream is not
configured, then you would be prompted for the push target instead.)

   Instead we are going to undo the changes made so far.  Bring up the
log for the current branch by typing ‘l l’, move to the last commit
created before starting with this walk through using ‘n’, and do a hard
reset using ‘C-u x’.  *WARNING*: this discards all uncommitted changes.
If you did not follow the advice about using a separate repository for
these experiments and did not create a snapshot of uncommitted changes
before starting to try out Magit, then don’t do this.

   So far we have mentioned the commit, push, and log popups.  These are
probably among the popups you will be using the most, but many others
exist.  To show a popup with all other popups (as well as the various
apply commands), type ‘h’.  Try a few.

   The key bindings in that popup correspond to the bindings in Magit
buffers, including but not limited to the status buffer.  So you could
type ‘h d’ to bring up the diff popup, but once you remember that "d"
stands for "diff", you would usually do so by just typing ‘d’.  But the
"popup of popups" is useful even once you have memorized all the
bindings, as it can provide easy access to Magit commands from non-Magit
buffers.  So you should bind this globally too:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x M-g") 'magit-dispatch-popup)

   You might also want to enable ‘global-magit-file-buffer-mode’ (see
*note File-buffer mode: File-buffer mode.).

4 Interface concepts
********************

* Menu:

* Modes and Buffers::
* Automatic save::
* Automatic refresh and revert::
* Sections::
* Popup buffers and prefix commands::
* Completion and confirmation::
* Running Git::


File: magit.info,  Node: Modes and Buffers,  Next: Automatic save,  Up: Interface concepts

4.1 Modes and Buffers
=====================

Magit provides several major modes.  For each of these modes there
usually exists only one buffer per repository.  Separate modes and thus
buffers exist for commits, diffs, logs, and some other things.

   In this manual we often speak about "Magit buffers".  By that we mean
buffers whose major-modes derive from ‘magit-mode’.

   Besides these special purpose buffers, there also exists an overview
buffer, called the *status buffer*.  Its usually from this buffer that
the user invokes Git commands, or creates or visits other buffers.

‘q’     (‘magit-mode-bury-buffer’)

     This command buries the current Magit buffer.  With a prefix
     argument, it instead kills the buffer.

     If ‘magit-restore-window-configuration’ is non-nil and the last
     configuration stored by ‘magit-mode-display-buffer’ originates from
     the selected frame (which usually is the case), then that is
     restored after burying or killing the buffer.

 -- User Option: magit-restore-window-configuration

     This option controls whether quitting a Magit buffer restores the
     previous window configuration.

   While it often is enough to have one buffer of a certain Magit mode
per repository, this is not always the case.  You might, for example,
want to view the diffs for two commits at the same time.  To do so,
first rename the existing revision buffer.  Then show another commit.
Usually that would reuse the existing buffer, but because its name no
longer matches the default name, a new buffer is created instead.  The
new buffer uses the default name, and therefore will be reused to show
other commits as usual.

‘M-x magit-rename-buffer’     (‘magit-rename-buffer’)

     This command changes the name of the current Magit buffer by
     appending ‘<N>’ and thereby keeping Magit from re-using it to
     display other information of the same kind.

     With a prefix argument, the user can pick an arbitrary name.

‘M-w’     (‘magit-copy-buffer-thing-as-kill’)

     This command saves a representation of the thing that is being
     displayed in the current buffer to the kill ring.

     In buffers in which it is undefined what this "buffer thing" is,
     this command instead saves the value of the current section, as
     ‘magit-copy-as-kill’ would.

     When the region is active, then this command behaves like
     ‘kill-ring-save’.

‘C-w’     (‘magit-copy-as-kill’)

     This commands saves the value of the current section to the kill
     ring.  For commits it saves the full hash.  For branches it saves
     the branch name, except when a prefix argument is used, then it
     saves the full hash.

     When the region is active, then this command behaves like
     ‘kill-ring-save’.


File: magit.info,  Node: Automatic save,  Next: Automatic refresh and revert,  Prev: Modes and Buffers,  Up: Interface concepts

4.2 Automatic save
==================

File-visiting buffers are by default saved at certain points in time.
This doesn’t guarantee that Magit buffers are always up-to-date, but,
provided one only edits files by editing them in Emacs and uses only
Magit to interact with Git, one can be fairly confident.  When in doubt
or after outside changes, type ‘g’ (‘magit-refresh’) to save and refresh
explicitly.

 -- User Option: magit-save-repository-buffers

     This option controls whether file-visiting buffers are saved before
     certain events.

     If this is non-nil then all modified file-visiting buffers
     belonging to the current repository may be saved before running
     commands, before creating new Magit buffers, and before explicitly
     refreshing such buffers.  If this is ‘dontask’ then this is done
     without user intervention.  If it is ‘t’ then the user has to
     confirm each save.


File: magit.info,  Node: Automatic refresh and revert,  Next: Sections,  Prev: Automatic save,  Up: Interface concepts

4.3 Automatic refresh and revert
================================

After running a command which may change the state of the current
repository, the current Magit buffer and the corresponding status buffer
are refreshed.  This ensures that the displayed information is
up-to-date but can lead to a noticeable delay in big repositories.
Other Magit buffers are not refreshed to keep the delay to a minimum and
also because doing so can sometimes be undesirable.

 -- User Option: magit-revert-buffers

     This option controls if and how file-visiting buffers in the
     current repository are reverted.

     Unmodified buffers visiting files belonging to the current
     repository may be reverted after refreshing the current Magit
     buffer and after running certain other commands.

        • ‘nil’

          Don’t revert any buffers.

        • ‘ask’

          List the buffers which might potentially have to be reverted
          and ask the user whether she wants to revert them.  If so,
          then do it synchronously.

        • ‘t’

          Revert the buffers synchronously, mentioning each one as it is
          being reverted and then also show a summary in the echo area.

        • ‘usage’

          Like ‘t’ but include usage information in the summary.  This
          is the default so that users come here and pick what is right
          for them.

        • ‘silent’

          Revert the buffers synchronously and be quiet about it.

        • NUMBER

          An integer or float.  Revert the buffers asynchronously,
          mentioning each one as it is being reverted.  If user input
          arrives, then stop reverting.  After NUMBER seconds resume
          reverting.

   Buffers can also be refreshed explicitly, which is useful in buffers
that weren’t current during the last refresh and after changes were made
to the repository outside of Magit.

‘g’     (‘magit-refresh’)

     This command refreshes the current buffer if its major mode derives
     from ‘magit-mode’ as well as the corresponding status buffer.

     If the option ‘magit-revert-buffers’ calls for it, then it also
     reverts all unmodified buffers that visit files being tracked in
     the current repository.

‘G’     (‘magit-refresh-all’)

     This command refreshes all Magit buffers belonging to the current
     repository and also reverts all unmodified buffers that visit files
     being tracked in the current repository.

     The file-visiting buffers are always reverted, even if
     ‘magit-revert-buffers’ is nil.

 -- User Option: magit-refresh-buffer-hook

     This hook is run in each Magit buffer that was refreshed during the
     current refresh - normally the current buffer and the status
     buffer.

 -- User Option: magit-after-revert-hook

     This hook is run in each file-visiting buffer belonging to the
     current repository that was actually reverted during a refresh.

     Note that adding something here is very expensive.  If you
     experience performance issues, you might want to check this hook,
     as well as ‘magit-not-reverted-hook’ and, if possible, remove some
     of the functions added by third-party packages.

 -- User Option: magit-not-reverted-hook

     This hook is run in each file-visiting buffer belonging to the
     current repository that was reverted during a refresh.  The file
     was not reverted because it did not change, and so Magit does not
     have to do anything.  This hook is intended for third-party
     extensions that need to run some functions even on such files.

4.4 Sections
============

Magit buffers are organized into nested sections, which can be collapsed
and expanded, similar to how sections are handled in Org mode.  Each
section also has a type, and some sections also have a value.  For each
section type there can also be a local keymap, shared by all sections of
that type.

   Taking advantage the section value and type, many commands operate on
the current section, or when the region is active and selects sections
of the same type, all of the selected sections.  Commands that only make
sense for a particular section type (as opposed to just behaving
differently depending on the type) are usually bound in section type
keymaps.

File: magit.info,  Node: Section movement,  Next: Section visibility,  Up: Sections

4.4.1 Section movement
----------------------

To move within a section use the usual keys (‘C-p’, ‘C-n’, ‘C-b’, ‘C-f’
etc), whose global bindings are not shadowed.  To move to another
section use the following commands.

‘p’     (‘magit-section-backward’)

     When not at the beginning of a section, then move to the beginning
     of the current section.  At the beginning of a section, instead
     move to the beginning of the previous visible section.

‘n’     (‘magit-section-forward’)

     Move to the beginning of the next visible section.

‘M-p’     (‘magit-section-backward-siblings’)

     Move to the beginning of the previous sibling section.  If there is
     no previous sibling section, then move to the parent section
     instead.

‘M-n’     (‘magit-section-forward-siblings’)

     Move to the beginning of the next sibling section.  If there is no
     next sibling section, then move to the parent section instead.

‘^’     (‘magit-section-up’)

     Move to the beginning of the parent of the current section.

   The above commands all call the hook ‘magit-section-movement-hook’.
And, except for the second, the below functions are all members of that
hook’s default value.

 -- Variable: magit-section-movement-hook

     This hook is run by all of the above movement commands, after
     arriving at the destination.

 -- Function: magit-hunk-set-window-start

     This hook function ensures that the beginning of the current
     section is visible, provided it is a ‘hunk’ section.  Otherwise, it
     does nothing.

 -- Function: magit-section-set-window-start

     This hook function ensures that the beginning of the current
     section is visible, regardless of the section’s type.  If you add
     this to ‘magit-section-movement-hook’, then you must remove the
     hunk-only variant in turn.

 -- Function: magit-log-maybe-show-commit

     This hook function shows the commit at point in another window.  If
     the section at point is a ‘commit’ section and the value of
     ‘magit-diff-auto-show-p’ calls for it, then the commit is shown in
     another window, using ‘magit-show-commit’.

 -- Function: magit-log-maybe-show-more-commits

     This hook function only has an effect in log buffers, and ‘point’
     is on the "show more" section.  If that is the case, then it
     doubles the number of commits that are being shown.

4.4.2 Section visibility
------------------------

Magit provides many commands for changing the visibility of sections,
but all you need to get started are the next two.

‘TAB’     (‘magit-section-toggle’)

     Toggle the visibility of the body of the current section.

‘C-<tab>’     (‘magit-section-cycle’)

     Cycle the visibility of current section and its children.

‘M-<tab>’     (‘magit-section-cycle-diffs’)

     Cycle the visibility of diff-related sections in the current
     buffer.

‘s-<tab>’     (‘magit-section-cycle-global’)

     Cycle the visibility of all sections in the current buffer.

 -- Command: magit-section-show-level-1
 -- Command: magit-section-show-level-2
 -- Command: magit-section-show-level-3
 -- Command: magit-section-show-level-4

     To show sections surrounding the current section, up to level N,
     press the respective number key (‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, or ‘4’).

 -- Command: magit-section-show-level-1-all
 -- Command: magit-section-show-level-2-all
 -- Command: magit-section-show-level-3-all
 -- Command: magit-section-show-level-4-all

     To show all sections up to level N, press the respective number key
     and meta (‘M-1’, ‘M-2’, ‘M-3’, or ‘M-4’).

   Some functions, which are used to implement the above commands, are
also exposed as commands themselves.  By default no keys are bound to
these commands, as they are generally perceived to be much less useful.
But your mileage may vary.

 -- Command: magit-section-show

     Show the body of the current section.

 -- Command: magit-section-hide

     Hide the body of the current section.

 -- Command: magit-section-show-headings

     Recursively show headings of children of the current section.  Only
     show the headings.  Previously shown text-only bodies are hidden.

 -- Command: magit-section-show-children

     Recursively show the bodies of children of the current section.
     With a prefix argument show children down to the level of the
     currect section, and hide deeper children.

 -- Command: magit-section-hide-children

     Recursively hide the bodies of children of the current section.

 -- Command: magit-section-toggle-children

     Toggle visibility of bodies of children of the current section.

   When a buffer is first created then some sections are shown expanded
while others are not.  This is hard coded.  When a buffer is refreshed
then the previous visibility is preserved.  The initial visibility of
certain sections can also be overwritten using the hook
‘magit-section-set-visibility-hook’.

 -- Variable: magit-section-set-visibility-hook

     This hook is run when first creating a buffer and also when
     refreshing an existing buffer, and is used to determine the
     visibility of the section currently being inserted.

     Each function is called with one argument, the section being
     inserted.  It should return ‘hide’ or ‘show’, or to leave the
     visibility undefined ‘nil’.  If no function decides on the
     visibility and the buffer is being refreshed, then the visibility
     is preserved; or if the buffer is being created, then the hard
     coded default is used.

     Usually this should only be used to set the initial visibility but
     not during refreshes.  If ‘magit-insert-section--oldroot’ is
     non-nil, then the buffer is being refreshed and these functions
     should immediately return ‘nil’.


File: magit.info,  Node: Section hooks,  Next: Section types and values,  Prev: Section visibility,  Up: Sections

4.4.3 Section hooks
-------------------

Which sections are inserted into certain buffers is controlled with
hooks.  This includes the status and the refs buffers.  For other
buffers, e.g.  log, diff, and revision buffers, this is not possible.

   For buffers whose sections can be customized by the user, a hook
variable called ‘magit-TYPE-sections-hook’ exists.  This hook should be
changed using ‘magit-add-section-hook’.  Avoid using ‘add-hooks’ or the
Custom interface.

   The various available section hook variables are described later in
this manual along with the appropriate "section inserter functions".

 -- Function: magit-add-section-hook hook function &optional at append
          local

     Add the function FUNCTION to the value of section hook HOOK.

     Add FUNCTION at the beginning of the hook list unless optional
     APPEND is non-nil, in which case FUNCTION is added at the end.  If
     FUNCTION already is a member then move it to the new location.

     If optional AT is non-nil and a member of the hook list, then add
     FUNCTION next to that instead.  Add before or after AT depending on
     APPEND. If only FUNCTION is a member of the list, then leave it
     wherever it already is.

     If optional LOCAL is non-nil, then modify the hook’s buffer-local
     value rather than its global value.  This makes the hook local by
     copying the default value.  That copy is then modified.

     HOOK should be a symbol.  If HOOK is void, it is first set to nil.
     HOOK’s value must not be a single hook function.  FUNCTION should
     be a function that takes no arguments and inserts one or multiple
     sections at point, moving point forward.  FUNCTION may choose not
     to insert its section(s), when doing so would not make sense.  It
     should not be abused for other side-effects.

   To remove a function from a section hook, use ‘remove-hook’.


File: magit.info,  Node: Section types and values,  Next: Section options,  Prev: Section hooks,  Up: Sections

4.4.4 Section types and values
------------------------------

Each section has a type, for example ‘hunk’, ‘file’, and ‘commit’.
Instances of certain section types also have a value.  The value of a
section of type ‘file’, for example, is a file name.

   Users usually do not have to worry about a section’s type and value,
but knowing them can be handy at times.

‘M-x magit-describe-section’     (‘magit-describe-section’)

     Show information about the section at point in the echo area, as
     "VALUE [TYPE PARENT-TYPE…] BEGINNING-END".

   Many commands behave differently depending on the type of the section
at point and/or somehow consume the value of that section.  But that is
only one of the reasons why the same key may do something different,
depending on what section is current.

   Additionally for each section type a keymap *might* be defined, named
‘magit-TYPE-section-map’.  That keymap is used as text property keymap
of all text belonging to any section of the respective type.  If such a
map does not exist for a certain type, then you can define it yourself,
and it will automatically be used.


File: magit.info,  Node: Section options,  Prev: Section types and values,  Up: Sections

4.4.5 Section options
---------------------

This section describes options that have an effect on more than just a
certain type of sections.  As you can see there are not many of those.

 -- User Option: magit-section-show-child-count

     Whether to append the number of children to section headings.  This
     only affects sections that could benefit from this information.


File: magit.info,  Node: Popup buffers and prefix commands,  Next: Completion and confirmation,  Prev: Sections,  Up: Interface concepts

4.5 Popup buffers and prefix commands
=====================================

Many Magit commands are implemented using *popup buffers*.  First the
user invokes a *popup* or *prefix* command, which causes a popup buffer
with the available *infix* arguments and *suffix* commands to be
displayed.  The user then optionally toggles/sets some arguments and
finally invokes one of the suffix commands.

   This is implemented in the library ‘magit-popup’.  Earlier releases
used the library ‘magit-key-mode’.  A future release will switch to a
yet-to-be-written successor, which will likely be named ‘transient’.

   Because ‘magit-popup’ can also be used by other packages without
having to depend on all of Magit, it is documented in its own manual.
See *note (magit-popup)Top::.

‘C-c C-c’     (‘magit-dispatch-popup’)

     This popup command shows a buffer featuring all other Magit popup
     commands as well as some other commands that are not popup commands
     themselves.

   This command is also, or especially, useful outside Magit buffers, so
you should setup a global binding:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x M-g") 'magit-dispatch-popup)


File: magit.info,  Node: Completion and confirmation,  Next: Running Git,  Prev: Popup buffers and prefix commands,  Up: Interface concepts

4.6 Completion and confirmation
===============================

Many commands read a value from the user.  By default this is done using
the built-in function ‘completing-read’, but Magit can instead use
another completion framework.

 -- User Option: magit-completing-read-function

     The value of this variable is the function used to perform
     completion.  Because functions _intended_ to replace
     ‘completing-read’ often are not fully compatible drop-in
     replacements, and also because Magit expects them to add the
     default choice to the prompt themselves, such functions should not
     be used directly.  Instead a wrapper function has to be used.

   Currently only the real ‘completing-read’ and Ido
(http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings) are fully
supported.  More frameworks will be supported in the future.

 -- Function: magit-builtin-completing-read prompt choices &optional
          predicate require-match initial-input hist def

     Perform completion using ‘completion-read’.

 -- Function: magit-ido-completing-read prompt choices &optional
          predicate require-match initial-input hist def

     Perform completion using ‘ido-completing-read+’ from the package by
     the same name (which you have to explicitly install).  Ido itself
     comes with a supposed drop-in replacement ‘ido-completing-read’,
     but that has too many deficits to serve our needs.

   By default many commands that could potentially lead to data loss
have to be confirmed.  This includes many very common commands, so this
can become annoying quickly.  Many of these actions can be undone,
provided ‘magit-wip-before-change-mode’ is turned on (which it is not by
default, due to performance concerns).

 -- User Option: magit-no-confirm

     The value of this option is a list of symbols, representing
     commands which do not have to be confirmed by the user before being
     carried out.

     When the global mode ‘magit-wip-before-change-mode’ is enabled then
     many commands can be undone.  If that mode is enabled then adding
     ‘safe-with-wip’ to this list has the same effect as adding
     ‘discard’, ‘reverse’, ‘stage-all-changes’, and
     ‘unstage-all-changes’.

          (add-to-list 'magit-no-confirm 'safe-with-wip)

     For a list of all symbols that can be added to the value of this
     variable, see the doc-string.

   Note that there are commands that ignore this option and always
require confirmation, or which can be told not to do so using another
dedicated option.  Also most commands, when acting on multiple sections
at once always, require confirmation, even when they do respect this
option when acting on a single section.

File: magit.info,  Node: Viewing Git output,  Next: Running Git manually,  Up: Running Git

4.7.1 Viewing Git output
------------------------

Magit runs Git either for side-effects (e.g.  when pushing) or to get
some value (e.g.  the name of the current branch).  When Git is run for
side-effects then the output goes into a per-repository log buffer,
which can be consulted when things don’t go as expected.

‘$’     (‘magit-process’)

     This commands displays the process buffer for the current
     repository.

   Inside that buffer, the usual key bindings for navigating and showing
sections are available.  There is one additional command.

‘k’     (‘magit-process-kill’)

     This command kills the process represented by the section at point.

 -- User Option: magit-git-debug

     When this is non-nil then the output of all calls to git are logged
     in the process buffer.  This is useful when debugging, otherwise it
     just negatively affects performance.


File: magit.info,  Node: Running Git manually,  Next: Git executable,  Prev: Viewing Git output,  Up: Running Git

4.7.2 Running Git manually
--------------------------

While Magit provides many Emacs commands to interact with Git, it does
not cover everything.  In those cases your existing Git knowledge will
come in handy.  Magit provides some commands for running arbitrary Git
commands by typing them into the minibuffer, instead of having to switch
to a shell.

‘!’     (‘magit-run-popup’)

     Shows the popup buffer featuring the below suffix commands.

   These suffix commands run a Git subcommand.  The user input has to
begin with the subcommand, "git" is assumed.

‘! !’     (‘magit-git-command-topdir’)

     This command reads a Git subcommand from the user and executes it
     in the top-level directory of the current repository.

‘! p’     (‘magit-git-command’)

     This command reads a Git subcommand from the user and executes it
     in ‘default-directory’.  With a prefix argument the command is
     executed in the top-level directory of the current repository
     instead.

   These suffix commands run arbitrary shell commands.

‘! !’     (‘magit-shell-command-topdir’)

     This command reads a shell command from the user and executes it in
     the top-level directory of the current repository.

‘! p’     (‘magit-shell-command’)

     This command reads a shell command from the user and executes it in
     ‘default-directory’.  With a prefix argument the command is
     executed in the top-level directory of the current repository
     instead.

   These suffix commands start external gui tools.

‘! k’     (‘magit-run-gitk’)

     This command runs ‘gitk’ in the current repository.

‘! a’     (‘magit-run-gitk-all’)

     This command runs ‘gitk --all’ in the current repository.

‘! b’     (‘magit-run-gitk-branches’)

     This command runs ‘gitk --branches’ in the current repository.

‘! g’     (‘magit-run-git-gui’)

     This command runs ‘git gui’ in the current repository.


File: magit.info,  Node: Git executable,  Next: Global Git arguments,  Prev: Running Git manually,  Up: Running Git

4.7.3 Git executable
--------------------

Except on MS Windows, Magit defaults to running Git without specifying
the path to the git executable.  Instead the first executable found by
Emacs on ‘exec-path’ is used (whose value in turn is set based on the
value of the environment variable ‘$PATH’ when Emacs was started).

   This has the advantage that it continues to work even when using
Tramp to connect to a remote machine on which the executable is found in
a different place.  The downside is that if you have multiple versions
of Git installed, then you might end up using another version than the
one you think you are using.

‘M-x magit-version’     (‘magit-version’)

     Shows the currently used versions of Magit, Git, and Emacs in the
     echo area.  Non-interactively this just returns the Magit version.

   When the ‘system-type’ is ‘windows-nt’, then ‘magit-git-executable’
is set to an absolute path when Magit is first loaded.  This is
necessary because Git on that platform comes with several wrapper
scripts for the actual git binary, which are also placed on ‘$PATH’, and
using one of these wrappers instead of the binary would degrade
performance horribly.

   If Magit doesn’t find the correct executable then you *can* work
around that by setting ‘magit-git-executable’ to an absolute path.  But
note that doing so is a kludge.  It is better to make sure the order in
the environment variable ‘$PATH’ is correct, and that Emacs is started
with that environment in effect.  If you have to connect from Windows to
a non-Windows machine, then you must change the value to "git".

 -- User Option: magit-git-executable

     The git executable used by Magit, either the full path to the
     executable or the string "git" to let Emacs find the executable
     itself, using the standard mechanism for doing such things.


File: magit.info,  Node: Global Git arguments,  Prev: Git executable,  Up: Running Git

4.7.4 Global Git arguments
--------------------------

 -- User Option: magit-git-global-arguments

     The arguments set here are used every time the git executable is
     run as a subprocess.  They are placed right after the executable
     itself and before the git command - as in ‘git HERE... COMMAND
     REST’.  For valid arguments see *note (gitman)git:: .

     Be careful what you add here, especially if you are using Tramp to
     connect to servers with ancient Git versions.  Never remove
     anything that is part of the default value, unless you really know
     what you are doing.  And think very hard before adding something;
     it will be used every time Magit runs Git for any purpose.


File: magit.info,  Node: Inspecting,  Next: Manipulating,  Prev: Interface concepts,  Up: Top

5 Inspecting
************

The functionality provided by Magit can be roughly divided into three
groups: inspecting existing data, manipulating existing data or adding
new data, and transferring data.  Of course that is a rather crude
distinction that often falls short, but it’s more useful than no
distinction at all.  This section is concerned with inspecting data, the
next two with manipulating and transferring it.  Then follows a section
about miscellaneous functionality, which cannot easily be fit into this
distinction.

   Of course other distinctions make sense too, e.g.  Git’s distinction
between porcelain and plumbing commands, which for the most part is
equivalent to Emacs’ distinction between interactive commands and
non-interactive functions.  All of the sections mentioned before are
mainly concerned with the porcelain – Magit’s plumbing layer is
described later.

File: magit.info,  Node: Status buffer,  Next: Logging,  Up: Inspecting

5.1 Status buffer
=================

While other Magit buffers contain e.g.  one particular diff or one
particular log, the status buffer contains the diffs for staged and
unstaged changes, logs for unpushed and unpulled commits, lists of
stashes and untracked files, and information related to the current
branch.

   During certain incomplete operations – for example when a merge
resulted in a conflict – additional information is displayed that helps
proceeding with or aborting the operation.

   The command ‘magit-status’ displays the status buffer belonging to
the current repository in another window.  This command is used so often
that it should be bound globally.  We recommend using ‘C-x g’:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x g") 'magit-status)

‘C-x g’     (‘magit-status’)

     Show the status of the current Git repository in a buffer.  With a
     prefix argument prompt for a repository to be shown.  With two
     prefix arguments prompt for an arbitrary directory.  If that
     directory isn’t the root of an existing repository, then offer to
     initialize it as a new repository.

 -- User Option: magit-repository-directories

     Directories containing Git repositories.  Magit checks these
     directories for Git repositories and offers them as choices when
     ‘magit-status’ is used with a prefix argument.

 -- User Option: magit-repository-directories-depth

     The maximum depth to look for Git repositories.  When looking for a
     Git repository below the directories in
     ‘magit-repository-directories’, only descend this many levels deep.

 -- Command: ido-enter-magit-status

     From an Ido prompt used to open a file, instead drop into
     ‘magit-status’.  This is similar to ‘ido-magic-delete-char’, which,
     despite its name, usually causes a Dired buffer to be created.

     To make this command available, use something like:

          (add-hook 'ido-setup-hook
                    (lambda ()
                      (define-key ido-completion-map
                        (kbd \"C-x g\") 'ido-enter-magit-status)))

     Starting with Emacs 25.1 the Ido keymaps are defined just once
     instead of every time Ido is invoked, so now you can modify it like
     pretty much every other keymap:

          (define-key ido-common-completion-map
            (kbd \"C-x g\") 'ido-enter-magit-status)

   The first function on that hook by default is
‘magit-insert-status-headers’; it is described in the next section.  By
default the following functions are also members of that hook:

 -- Function: magit-insert-merge-log

     Insert section for the on-going merge.  Display the heads that are
     being merged.  If no merge is in progress, do nothing.

 -- Function: magit-insert-rebase-sequence

     Insert section for the on-going rebase sequence.  If no such
     sequence is in progress, do nothing.

 -- Function: magit-insert-am-sequence

     Insert section for the on-going patch applying sequence.  If no
     such sequence is in progress, do nothing.

 -- Function: magit-insert-sequencer-sequence

     Insert section for the on-going cherry-pick or revert sequence.  If
     no such sequence is in progress, do nothing.

 -- Function: magit-insert-bisect-output

     While bisecting, insert section with output from ‘git bisect’.

 -- Function: magit-insert-bisect-rest

     While bisecting, insert section visualizing the bisect state.

 -- Function: magit-insert-bisect-log

     While bisecting, insert section logging bisect progress.

 -- Function: magit-insert-untracked-files

     Maybe insert a list or tree of untracked files.  Do so depending on
     the value of ‘status.showUntrackedFiles’.

 -- Function: magit-insert-unstaged-changes

     Insert section showing unstaged changes.

 -- Function: magit-insert-staged-changes

     Insert section showing staged changes.

 -- Function: magit-insert-stashes &optional ref heading

     Insert the ‘stashes’ section showing reflog for "refs/stash".  If
     optional REF is non-nil show reflog for that instead.  If optional
     HEADING is non-nil use that as section heading instead of
     "Stashes:".

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpulled-commits

     Insert section showing unpulled commits.

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpushed-commits

     Insert section showing unpushed commits.

   The following functions can also be added to the above hook:

 -- Function: magit-insert-tracked-files

     Insert a tree of tracked files.

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpulled-or-recent-commits

     Insert section showing unpulled or recent commits.  If an upstream
     is configured for the current branch and it is ahead of the current
     branch, then show the missing commits.  Otherwise, show the last
     ‘magit-log-section-commit-count’ commits.

 -- Function: magit-insert-recent-commits

     Insert section showing the last ‘magit-log-section-commit-count’
     commits.

 -- User Option: magit-log-section-commit-count

     How many recent commits ‘magit-insert-recent-commits’ and
     ‘magit-insert-unpulled-or-recent-commits’ (provided there are no
     unpulled commits) show.

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpulled-cherries

     Insert section showing unpulled commits.  Like
     ‘magit-insert-unpulled-commits’ but prefix each commit that has not
     been applied yet (i.e.  a commit with a patch-id not shared with
     any local commit) with "+", and all others with "-".

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpulled-module-commits

     Insert sections for all submodules with unpulled commits.  These
     sections can be expanded to show the respective commits.

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpushed-cherries

     Insert section showing unpushed commits.  Like
     ‘magit-insert-unpushed-commits’ but prefix each commit which has
     not been applied to upstream yet (i.e.  a commit with a patch-id
     not shared with any upstream commit) with "+" and all others with
     "-".

 -- Function: magit-insert-unpushed-module-commits

     Insert sections for all submodules with unpushed commits.  These
     sections can be expanded to show the respective commits.

   See *note References buffer: References buffer. for some more section
inserters, which could be used here.


File: magit.info,  Node: Status header sections,  Next: Status options,  Prev: Status sections,  Up: Status buffer

5.1.2 Status header sections
----------------------------

The contents of status buffers is controlled using the hook
‘magit-status-sections-hook’, as described in the previous section.  By
default ‘magit-insert-status-headers’ is the first member of that hook
variable.

 -- Function: magit-insert-status-headers

     Insert headers sections appropriate for ‘magit-status-mode’
     buffers.  The sections are inserted by running the functions on the
     hook ‘magit-status-headers-hook’.

 -- User Option: magit-status-headers-hook

     Hook run to insert headers sections into the status buffer.

     This hook is run by ‘magit-insert-status-headers’, which in turn
     has to be a member of ‘magit-insert-status-sections’ to be used at
     all.

   By default the following functions are members of the above hook:

 -- Function: magit-insert-head-header

     Insert a header line about the ‘HEAD’ commit.

 -- Function: magit-insert-upstream-header

     Insert a header line about the upstream branch and its tip.

 -- Function: magit-insert-tags-header

     Insert a header line about the current and/or next tag.

   The following functions can also be added to the above hook:

 -- Function: magit-insert-repo-header

     Insert a header line showing the path to the repository top-level.

 -- Function: magit-insert-remote-header

     Insert a header line about the remote of the current branch.

     If no remote is configured for the current branch, then fall back
     showing the "origin" remote, or if that does not exist the first
     remote in alphabetic order.

 -- Function: magit-insert-user-header

     Insert a header line about the current user.


File: magit.info,  Node: Status options,  Prev: Status header sections,  Up: Status buffer

5.1.3 Status options
--------------------

 -- User Option: magit-status-refresh-hook

     Hook run after a status buffer has been refreshed.

 -- User Option: magit-status-buffer-switch-function

     Function used by ‘magit-status’ to switch to a status buffer.  The
     function is given one argument, the status buffer.

 -- User Option: magit-status-buffer-name-format

     Name format for buffers used to display a repository’s status.

     The following ‘format’-like specs are supported: ‘%a’ the absolute
     filename of the repository top-level.  ‘%b’ the basename of the
     repository top-level.

 -- User Option: magit-log-section-args

     Additional Git arguments used when creating log sections.  Only
     ‘--graph’, ‘--decorate’, and ‘--show-signature’ are supported.
     This option is only a temporary kludge and will be removed.

     Note that due to an issue in Git the use of ‘--graph’ is very slow
     with long histories, so you probably don’t want to add this here.

   Also see the proceeding section for more options concerning status
buffers.

5.2 Logging
===========

The status buffer contains logs for the unpushed and unpulled commits,
but that obviously isn’t enough.  The prefix command ‘magit-log-popup’,
on ‘l’, features several suffix commands, which show a specific log in a
separate log buffer.

   Like other popups, the log popup also features several arguments that
can be changed before invoking one of the suffix commands.  However in
case of the log popup these arguments correspond to those currently in
use in the current repository’s log buffer.  When the log popup is
invoked while no log buffer exists for the current repository yet, then
the default value of ‘magit-log-arguments’ is used instead.

   For information about the various arguments, see *note
(gitman)git-log:: .

   The log popup also features several reflog commands.  See *note
Reflog: Reflog.

‘l’     (‘magit-log-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.

‘l l’     (‘magit-log-current’)

     Show log for the current branch.  When ‘HEAD’ is detached or with a
     prefix argument, show log for one or more revs read from the
     minibuffer.

‘l o’     (‘magit-log’)

     Show log for one or more revs read from the minibuffer.  The user
     can input any revision or revisions separated by a space, or even
     ranges, but only branches, tags, and a representation of the commit
     at point are available as completion candidates.

‘l h’     (‘magit-log-head’)

     Show log for ‘HEAD’.

‘l L’     (‘magit-log-branches’)

     Show log for all local branches and ‘HEAD’.

‘l b’     (‘magit-log-all-branches’)

     Show log for all local and remote branches and ‘HEAD’.

‘l a’     (‘magit-log-all’)

     Show log for all references and ‘HEAD’.

   The following related commands are not available from the popup.

‘Y’     (‘magit-cherry’)

     Show commits in a branch that are not merged in the upstream
     branch.

‘M-x magit-log-buffer-file’     (‘magit-log-buffer-file’)

     Show log for the file visited in the current buffer.

File: magit.info,  Node: Refreshing logs,  Next: Log Buffer,  Up: Logging

5.2.1 Refreshing logs
---------------------

The prefix command ‘magit-log-refresh-popup’, on ‘L’, can be used to
change the log arguments used in the current buffer, without changing
which log is shown.  This works in dedicated log buffers, but also in
the status buffer.

‘L’     (‘magit-log-refresh-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.

‘L g’     (‘magit-log-refresh’)

     This suffix command sets the local log arguments for the current
     buffer.

‘L s’     (‘magit-log-set-default-arguments’)

     This suffix command sets the default log arguments for buffers of
     the same type as that of the current buffer.  Other existing
     buffers of the same type are not affected because their local
     values have already been initialized.

‘L w’     (‘magit-log-save-default-arguments’)

     This suffix command sets the default log arguments for buffers of
     the same type as that of the current buffer, and saves the value
     for future sessions.  Other existing buffers of the same type are
     not affected because their local values have already been
     initialized.

‘L t’     (‘magit-toggle-margin’)

     Show or hide the margin.


File: magit.info,  Node: Log Buffer,  Next: Select from log,  Prev: Refreshing logs,  Up: Logging

5.2.2 Log Buffer
----------------

‘C-c C-b’     (‘magit-go-backward’)

     Move backward in current buffer’s history.

‘C-c C-f’     (‘magit-go-forward’)

     Move forward in current buffer’s history.

‘SPC’     (‘magit-diff-show-or-scroll-up’)

     Update the commit or diff buffer for the thing at point.

     Either show the commit or stash at point in the appropriate buffer,
     or if that buffer is already being displayed in the current frame
     and contains information about that commit or stash, then instead
     scroll the buffer up.  If there is no commit or stash at point,
     then prompt for a commit.

‘DEL’     (‘magit-diff-show-or-scroll-down’)

     Update the commit or diff buffer for the thing at point.

     Either show the commit or stash at point in the appropriate buffer,
     or if that buffer is already being displayed in the current frame
     and contains information about that commit or stash, then instead
     scroll the buffer down.  If there is no commit or stash at point,
     then prompt for a commit.

‘q’     (‘magit-log-bury-buffer’)

     Bury the current buffer or the revision buffer in the same frame.
     Like ‘magit-mode-bury-buffer’ (which see) but with a negative
     prefix argument instead bury the revision buffer, provided it is
     displayed in the current frame.

 -- User Option: magit-log-auto-more

     Insert more log entries automatically when moving past the last
     entry.  Only considered when moving past the last entry with
     ‘magit-goto-*-section’ commands.

‘+’     (‘magit-log-show-more-commits’)

     Increase the number of commits shown in current log.

     With no prefix argument, show twice as many commits as before.
     With a numerical prefix argument, show this many additional
     commits.  With a non-numeric prefix argument, show all commits.

     When no limit was previously imposed in the current buffer, set the
     local limit to the default limit instead (or if that is nil then
     100), regardless of the prefix argument.

     By default ‘magit-log-cutoff-length’ commits are shown.

 -- User Option: magit-log-show-margin

     Whether to initially show the margin in log buffers.

     When non-nil the author name and date are initially displayed in
     the margin of log buffers.  The margin can be shown or hidden in
     the current buffer using the command ‘magit-toggle-margin’.

     When a log buffer contains a verbose log, then the margin is never
     displayed.  In status buffers this option is ignored, but it is
     possible to show the margin using the mentioned command.

‘L’     (‘magit-log-refresh-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.  See *note
     Refreshing logs: Refreshing logs.

 -- User Option: magit-log-cutoff-length

     The maximum number of commits to show in log and reflog buffers.

 -- User Option: magit-log-show-refname-after-summary

     Whether to show the refnames after the commit summaries.  This is
     useful if you use really long branch names.


File: magit.info,  Node: Select from log,  Next: Reflog,  Prev: Log Buffer,  Up: Logging

5.2.3 Select from log
---------------------

When the user has to select a recent commit that is reachable from
‘HEAD’, using regular completion would be inconvenient (because most
humans cannot remember hashes or "HEAD~5", at least not without double
checking).  Instead a log buffer is used to select the commit, which has
the advantage that commits are presented in order and with the commit
message.  The following additional key bindings are available when a log
is used for selection:

‘C-c C-c’     (‘magit-log-select-pick’)

     Select the commit at point and act on it.  Call
     ‘magit-log-select-pick-function’ with the selected commit as
     argument.

‘C-c C-k’     (‘magit-log-select-quit’)

     Abort selecting a commit, don’t act on any commit.

   This feature is used by rebase and squash commands.


File: magit.info,  Node: Reflog,  Prev: Select from log,  Up: Logging

5.2.4 Reflog
------------

Also see *note (gitman)git-reflog:: .

   These reflog commands are available from the log popup.  See *note
Logging: Logging.

‘l r’     (‘magit-reflog-current’)

     Display the reflog of the current branch.

‘l O’     (‘magit-reflog-other’)

     Display the reflog of a branch.

‘l H’     (‘magit-reflog-head’)

     Display the ‘HEAD’ reflog.

5.3 Diffing
===========

The status buffer contains diffs for the staged and unstaged commits,
but that obviously isn’t enough.  The prefix command ‘magit-diff-popup’,
on ‘d’, features several suffix commands, which show a specific diff in
a separate diff buffer.

   Like other popups, the diff popup also features several arguments
that can be changed before invoking one of the suffix commands.  However
in case of the diff popup these arguments correspond to those currently
in use in the current repository’s diff buffer.  When the diff popup is
invoked while no diff buffer exists for the current repository yet, then
the default value of ‘magit-diff-arguments’ is used instead.

   Also see *note (gitman)git-diff:: .

‘d’     (‘magit-diff-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.

‘d d’     (‘magit-diff-dwim’)

     Show changes for the thing at point.

‘d r’     (‘magit-diff’)

     Show differences between two commits.

     RANGE should be a range (A..B or A…B) but can also be a single
     commit.  If one side of the range is omitted, then it defaults to
     HEAD. If just a commit is given, then changes in the working tree
     relative to that commit are shown.

     If the region is active, use the revisions on the first and last
     line of the region.  With a prefix argument, instead of diffing the
     revisions, choose a revision to view changes along, starting at the
     common ancestor of both revisions (i.e., use a "…" range).

‘d w’     (‘magit-diff-worktree’)

     Show changes between the current working tree and the ‘HEAD’
     commit.  With a prefix argument show changes between the working
     tree and a commit read from the minibuffer.

‘d s’     (‘magit-diff-staged’)

     Show changes between the index and the ‘HEAD’ commit.  With a
     prefix argument show changes between the index and a commit read
     from the minibuffer.

‘d u’     (‘magit-diff-unstaged’)

     Show changes between the working tree and the index.

‘d p’     (‘magit-diff-paths’)

     Show changes between any two files on disk.

‘M-x magit-diff-unpushed’     (‘magit-diff-unpushed’)

     Show unpushed changes.

‘M-x magit-diff-unpulled’     (‘magit-diff-unpulled’)

     Show unpulled changes.

   All of the above suffix commands update the repository’s diff buffer.
The diff popup also features two commands which show differences in
another buffer:

‘d c’     (‘magit-show-commit’)

     Show the commit at point.  If there is no commit at point or with a
     prefix argument, prompt for a commit.

‘d t’     (‘magit-stash-show’)

     Show all diffs of a stash in a buffer.

File: magit.info,  Node: Refreshing diffs,  Next: Diff buffer,  Up: Diffing

5.3.1 Refreshing diffs
----------------------

The prefix command ‘magit-diff-refresh-popup’, on ‘D’, can be used to
change the diff arguments used in the current buffer, without changing
which diff is shown.  This works in dedicated diff buffers, but also in
the status buffer.

‘D’     (‘magit-diff-refresh-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.

‘D g’     (‘magit-diff-refresh’)

     This suffix command sets the local diff arguments for the current
     buffer.

‘D s’     (‘magit-diff-set-default-arguments’)

     This suffix command sets the default diff arguments for buffers of
     the same type as that of the current buffer.  Other existing
     buffers of the same type are not affected because their local
     values have already been initialized.

‘D w’     (‘magit-diff-save-default-arguments’)

     This suffix command sets the default diff arguments for buffers of
     the same type as that of the current buffer, and saves the value
     for future sessions.  Other existing buffers of the same type are
     not affected because their local values have already been
     initialized.

‘D t’     (‘magit-diff-toggle-refine-hunk’)

     This command toggles hunk refinement on or off.

‘D r’     (‘magit-diff-switch-range-type’)

     This command converts the diff range type from "revA..revB" to
     "revB…revA", or vice versa.

‘D f’     (‘magit-diff-flip-revs’)

     This command swaps revisions in the diff range from "revA..revB" to
     "revB..revA", or vice versa.

   In addition to the above popup, which allows changing any of the
supported arguments, there also exist some commands which change a
particular argument.

‘-’     (‘magit-diff-less-context’)

     This command decreases the context for diff hunks by COUNT lines.

‘+’     (‘magit-diff-more-context’)

     This command increases the context for diff hunks by COUNT lines.

‘0’     (‘magit-diff-default-context’)

     This command resets the context for diff hunks to the default
     height.

   The following commands quicky change what diff is being displayed
without having to using one of the diff popups.

‘C-c C-d’     (‘magit-diff-while-committing’)

     While committing, this command shows the changes that are about to
     be committed.  While amending, invoking the command again toggles
     between showing just the new changes or all the changes that will
     be committed.

     This binding is available in the diff buffer as well as the commit
     message buffer.

‘C-c C-b’     (‘magit-go-backward’)

     This command moves backward in current buffer’s history.

‘C-c C-f’     (‘magit-go-forward’)

     This command moves forward in current buffer’s history.


File: magit.info,  Node: Diff buffer,  Next: Diff options,  Prev: Refreshing diffs,  Up: Diffing

5.3.2 Diff buffer
-----------------

‘RET’     (‘magit-diff-visit-file’)

     From a diff, visit the corresponding file at the appropriate
     position.

     When the file is already being displayed in another window of the
     same frame, then just select that window and adjust point.  With a
     prefix argument also display in another window.

     If the diff shows changes in the worktree, the index, or ‘HEAD’,
     then visit the actual file.  Otherwise when the diff is about an
     older commit, then visit the respective blob using
     ‘magit-find-file’.  Also see ‘magit-diff-visit-file-worktree’,
     which, as the name suggests, always visits the actual file.

‘C-<return>’     (‘magit-diff-visit-file-worktree’)

     From a diff, visit the corresponding file at the appropriate
     position.

     When the file is already being displayed in another window of the
     same frame, then just select that window and adjust point.  With a
     prefix argument also display in another window.

     The actual file in the worktree is visited.  The positions in the
     hunk headers get less useful the "older" the changes are, and as a
     result, jumping to the appropriate position gets less reliable.

     Also see ‘magit-diff-visit-file-worktree’, which visits the
     respective blob, unless the diff shows changes in the worktree, the
     index, or ‘HEAD’.

‘j’     (‘magit-jump-to-diffstat-or-diff’)

     Jump to the diffstat or diff.  When point is on a file inside the
     diffstat section, then jump to the respective diff section.
     Otherwise, jump to the diffstat section or a child thereof.

‘SPC’     (‘scroll-up’)

     Scroll text upward.

‘DEL’     (‘scroll-down’)

     Scroll text downward.


File: magit.info,  Node: Diff options,  Next: Revision buffer,  Prev: Diff buffer,  Up: Diffing

5.3.3 Diff options
------------------

 -- User Option: magit-diff-show-diffstat

     Whether to show diffstat in diff buffers.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-show-xref-buttons

     Whether to show buffer history buttons in diff buffers.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-auto-show

     Whether to automatically show the relevant diff or commit.

     When this option is non-nil certain operations cause the relevant
     changes to be displayed automatically.

        • ‘commit’

        • ‘stage-all’

        • ‘log-oneline’

        • ‘log-follow’

        • ‘log-select’

        • ‘blame-follow’
     In the event that expanding very large patches takes a long time,
     ‘C-g’ can be used to abort that step.  This is especially useful
     when you would normally not look at the changes, e.g.  because you
     are committing some binary files.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-auto-show-delay

     How long to delay showing or updating the revision buffer, when
     that happens automatically (according to ‘magit-diff-auto-show’).

     When holding down a key to move by several lines, then that would
     update that buffer for each line on the way.  To prevent that,
     updating the revision buffer is delayed, and this option controls
     for how long it is delayed.  For optimal experience you might have
     to adjust this delay and/or the keyboard repeat rate and delay of
     your graphical environment or operating system.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-refine-hunk

     Whether to show word-granularity differences within diff hunks.

        • ‘nil’ never show fine differences.

        • ‘t’ show fine differences for the current diff hunk only.

        • ‘all’ show fine differences for all displayed diff hunks.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-paint-whitespace

     Specify where to highlight whitespace errors.

     See ‘magit-highlight-trailing-whitespace’,
     ‘magit-highlight-indentation’.  The symbol ‘t’ means in all diffs,
     ‘status’ means only in the status buffer, and nil means nowhere.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-highlight-trailing

     Whether to highlight whitespace at the end of a line in diffs.
     Used only when ‘magit-diff-paint-whitespace’ is non-nil.

 -- User Option: magit-diff-highlight-indentation

     Highlight the "wrong" indentation style.  Used only when
     ‘magit-diff-paint-whitespace’ is non-nil.

     The value is a list of cons cells.  The car is a regular
     expression, and the cdr is the value that applies to repositories
     whose directory matches the regular expression.  If more than one
     element matches, then the *last* element in the list applies.  The
     default value should therefore come first in the list.

     If the value is ‘tabs’, highlight indentation with tabs.  If the

5.4 Ediffing
============

‘e’     (‘magit-ediff-dwim’)

     Compare, stage, or resolve using Ediff.

     This command tries to guess what file, and what commit or range the
     user wants to compare, stage, or resolve using Ediff.  It might
     only be able to guess either the file, or range/commit, in which
     case the user is asked about the other.  It might not always guess
     right, in which case the appropriate ‘magit-ediff-*’ command has to
     be used explicitly.  If it cannot read the user’s mind at all, then
     it asks the user for a command to run.

‘E’     (‘magit-ediff-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands in a popup
     buffer.

‘E r’     (‘magit-ediff-compare’)

     Compare two revisions of a file using Ediff.

     If the region is active, use the revisions on the first and last
     line of the region.  With a prefix argument, instead of diffing the
     revisions, choose a revision to view changes along, starting at the
     common ancestor of both revisions (i.e., use a "…" range).

‘E m’     (‘magit-ediff-resolve’)

     Resolve outstanding conflicts in a file using Ediff, defaulting to
     the file at point.

     Provided that the value of ‘merge.conflictstyle’ is ‘diff3’, you
     can view the file’s merge-base revision using ‘/’ in the Ediff
     control buffer.

     In the rare event that you want to manually resolve all conflicts,
     including those already resolved by Git, use
     ‘ediff-merge-revisions-with-ancestor’.

‘E s’     (‘magit-ediff-stage’)

     Stage and unstage changes to a file using Ediff, defaulting to the
     file at point.

‘E u’     (‘magit-ediff-show-unstaged’)

     Show unstaged changes to a file using Ediff.

‘E i’     (‘magit-ediff-show-staged’)

     Show staged changes to a file using Ediff.

‘E w’     (‘magit-ediff-show-working-tree’)

     Show changes in a file between HEAD and working tree using Ediff.

‘E c’     (‘magit-ediff-show-commit’)

     Show changes to a file introduced by a commit using Ediff.

 -- User Option: magit-ediff-dwim-show-on-hunks

     This option controls what command ‘magit-ediff-dwim’ calls when
     point is on uncommitted hunks.  When nil, always run
     ‘magit-ediff-stage’.  Otherwise, use ‘magit-ediff-show-staged’ and
     ‘magit-ediff-show-unstaged’ to show staged and unstaged changes,
     respectively.

 -- User Option: magit-ediff-quit-hook

     This hook is run after quitting an Ediff session that was created
     using a Magit command.  The hook functions are run inside the Ediff
     control buffer, and should not change the current buffer.

     This is similar to ‘ediff-quit-hook’ but takes the needs of Magit
     into account.  The regular ‘ediff-quit-hook’ is ignored by Ediff
     sessions that were created using a Magit command.

5.5 References buffer
=====================

‘y’     (‘magit-show-refs-popup’)

     List and compare references in a dedicated buffer.  By default all
     refs are compared with ‘HEAD’, but with a prefix argument this
     command instead acts as a prefix command and shows the following
     suffix commands along with the appropriate infix arguments in a
     popup buffer.

‘y y’     (‘magit-show-refs-head’)

     List and compare references in a dedicated buffer.  Refs are
     compared with ‘HEAD’.

‘y c’     (‘magit-show-refs-current’)

     List and compare references in a dedicated buffer.  Refs are
     compared with the current branch or ‘HEAD’ if it is detached.

‘y o’     (‘magit-show-refs’)

     List and compare references in a dedicated buffer.  Refs are
     compared with a branch read from the user.

 -- User Option: magit-refs-show-commit-count

     Whether to show commit counts in Magit-Refs mode buffers.

        • all Show counts for branches and tags.

        • ‘branch’ Show counts for branches only.

        • ‘nil’ Never show counts.
     The default is ‘nil’ because anything else can be very expensive.

 -- User Option: magit-refs-show-margin

     Whether to initially show the margin in refs buffers.

     When non-nil the committer name and date are initially displayed in
     the margin of refs buffers.  The margin can be shown or hidden in
     the current buffer using the command ‘magit-toggle-margin’.

   The following variables control how individual refs are displayed.
If you change one of these variables (especially the "%c" part), then
you should also change the others to keep things aligned.  The following
%-sequences are supported:

   • ‘%a’ Number of commits this ref has over the one we compare to.

   • ‘%b’ Number of commits the ref we compare to has over this one.

   • ‘%c’ Number of commits this ref has over the one we compare to.
     For the ref which all other refs are compared this is instead "@",
     if it is the current branch, or "#" otherwise.

   • ‘%C’ For the ref which all other refs are compared this is "@", if
     it is the current branch, or "#" otherwise.  For all other refs "
     ".

   • ‘%h’ Hash of this ref’s tip.

   • ‘%m’ Commit summary of the tip of this ref.

   • ‘%n’ Name of this ref.

   • ‘%u’ Upstream of this local branch and additional local vs.
     upstream information.

   • ‘%U’ Upstream of this local branch.

 -- Variable: magit-refs-local-branch-format

     Format used for local branches in refs buffers.

 -- Variable: magit-refs-remote-branch-format

     Format used for remote branches in refs buffers.

 -- Variable: magit-refs-tags-format

     Format used for tags in refs buffers.

 -- Variable: magit-refs-indent-cherry-lines

     Indentation of cherries in refs buffers.  This should be N-1 where
     N is taken from "%Nc" in the above format strings.

   Everywhere in Magit ‘RET’ visits the thing represented by the section
at point.  In almost all cases visiting is done by showing some
information in another buffer and *not* doing anything else.  In refs
buffers ‘RET’ behaves differently, and because many users have grown
accustomed to that inconsistency we are keeping it that way.

‘RET’     (‘magit-visit-ref’)

     Everywhere except in refs buffers this command behaves exactly like
     ‘magit-show-commit’; it shows the commit at point in another
     buffer.

     In refs buffers, when there is a local branch at point, then this
     command instead checks out that branch.  When there is a remote
     branch or a tag at point then the respective commit is checked out
     causing ‘HEAD’ to be detached.

     When a prefix argument it used, then this command only *focuses* on
     the reference at point, i.e.  the commit counts and cherries are
     updated to be relative to that reference, but nothing is checked
     out.

 -- User Option: magit-visit-ref-create

     When this is non-nil and ‘magit-visit-ref’ is called inside a refs
     buffer, then it "visits" the remote branch at point by creating a
     new local branch which tracks that remote branch and then checking
     out the newly created branch.

     This is not enabled by default because one has to use an extremely
     loose definition of the verb "to visit" to be able to argue that
     creating and then checking out a new local branch is a form of
     visiting a remote branch.

5.6 Bisecting
=============

Also see *note (gitman)git-bisect:: .

‘B’     (‘magit-bisect-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands in a popup
     buffer.

   When bisecting is not in progress, then the popup buffer features the
following commands.

‘B s’     (‘magit-bisect-start’)

     Start a bisect session.

     Bisecting a bug means to find the commit that introduced it.  This
     command starts such a bisect session by asking for a known good and
     a bad commit.

‘B u’     (‘magit-bisect-run’)

     Bisect automatically by running commands after each step.

   When bisecting is in progress, then the popup buffer features these
commands instead.

‘B b’     (‘magit-bisect-bad’)

     Mark the current commit as bad.  Use this after you have asserted
     that the commit does contain the bug in question.

‘B g’     (‘magit-bisect-good’)

     Mark the current commit as good.  Use this after you have asserted
     that the commit does not contain the bug in question.

‘B k’     (‘magit-bisect-skip’)

     Skip the current commit.  Use this if for some reason the current
     commit is not a good one to test.  This command lets Git choose a
     different one.

‘B r’     (‘magit-bisect-reset’)

     After bisecting, cleanup bisection state and return to original
     ‘HEAD’.

5.7 Visiting blobs
==================

‘M-x magit-find-file’     (‘magit-find-file’)

     View FILE from REV. Switch to a buffer visiting blob REV:FILE,
     creating one if none already exists.

‘M-x magit-find-file-other-window’     (‘magit-find-file-other-window’)

     View FILE from REV, in another window.  Like ‘magit-find-file’, but
     create a new window or reuse an existing one.


File: magit.info,  Node: Blaming,  Prev: Visiting blobs,  Up: Inspecting

5.8 Blaming
===========

Also see *note (gitman)git-blame:: .

‘M-x magit-blame’     (‘magit-blame’)

     Display edit history of FILE up to REVISION.

     Interactively blame the file being visited in the current buffer.
     If the buffer visits a revision of that file, then blame up to that
     revision.  Otherwise, blame the file’s full history, including
     uncommitted changes.

     If Magit-Blame mode is already turned on then blame recursively, by
     visiting REVISION:FILE (using ‘magit-find-file’), where revision is
     the revision before the revision that added the lines at point.

     ARGS is a list of additional arguments to pass to ‘git blame’; only
     arguments available from ‘magit-blame-popup’ should be used.

‘M-x magit-blame-popup’     (‘magit-blame-popup’)

     By default this behaves just like ‘magit-blame’.  With a prefix
     argument instead show a popup buffer featuring a few infix
     arguments and a single suffix command (‘magit-blame’).

‘RET’     (‘magit-show-commit’)

     Show the commit at point.  If there is no commit at point or with a
     prefix argument, prompt for a commit.

‘SPC’     (‘magit-diff-show-or-scroll-up’)

     Update the commit or diff buffer for the thing at point.

     Either show the commit or stash at point in the appropriate buffer,
     or if that buffer is already being displayed in the current frame
     and contains information about that commit or stash, then instead
     scroll the buffer up.  If there is no commit or stash at point,
     then prompt for a commit.

‘DEL’     (‘magit-diff-show-or-scroll-down’)

     Update the commit or diff buffer for the thing at point.

     Either show the commit or stash at point in the appropriate buffer,
     or if that buffer is already being displayed in the current frame
     and contains information about that commit or stash, then instead
     scroll the buffer down.  If there is no commit or stash at point,
     then prompt for a commit.

‘n’     (‘magit-blame-next-chunk’)

     Move to the next chunk.

‘N’     (‘magit-blame-next-chunk-same-commit’)

     Move to the next chunk from the same commit.

‘p’     (‘magit-blame-previous-chunk’)

     Move to the previous chunk.

‘P’     (‘magit-blame-previous-chunk-same-commit’)

     Move to the previous chunk from the same commit.

‘q’     (‘magit-blame-quit’)

     Turn off Magit-Blame mode.  If the buffer was created during a
     recursive blame, then also kill the buffer.

‘M-w’     (‘magit-blame-copy-hash’)

     Save the hash of the current chunk’s commit to the kill ring.

‘t’     (‘magit-blame-toggle-headings’)

     Show or hide blame chunk headings.

 -- User Option: magit-blame-heading-format

     Format string used for blame headings.

 -- User Option: magit-blame-time-format

     Format string used for time strings in blame headings.

 -- User Option: magit-blame-show-headings

     Whether to initially show blame block headings.  The headings can
     also be toggled locally using command magit-blame-toggle-headings.

 -- User Option: magit-blame-goto-chunk-hook

     Hook run by ‘magit-blame-next-chunk’ and

‘M-x magit-init’     (‘magit-init’)

     This command initializes a repository and then shows the status
     buffer for the new repository.

     If the directory is below an existing repository, then the user has
     to confirm that a new one should be created inside.  If the
     directory is the root of the existing repository, then the user has
     to confirm that it should be reinitialized.

‘M-x magit-clone’     (‘magit-clone’)

     This command clones a repository and then shows the status buffer
     for the new repository.

     The user is queried for a remote url and a local directory.


File: magit.info,  Node: Staging and unstaging,  Next: Applying,  Prev: Repository setup,  Up: Manipulating

6.2 Staging and unstaging
=========================

Like Git, Magit can of course stage and unstage complete files.  Unlike
Git, it also allows users to gracefully un-/stage individual hunks and
even just part of a hunk.  To stage individual hunks and parts of hunks
using Git directly, one has to use the very modal and rather clumsy
interface of a ‘git add --interactive’ session.

   With Magit, on the other hand, one can un-/stage individual hunks by
just moving point into the respective section inside a diff displayed in
the status buffer or a separate diff buffer and typing ‘s’ or ‘u’.  To
operate on just parts of a hunk, mark the changes that should be
un-/staged using the region and then press the same key that would be
used to un-/stage.  To stage multiple files or hunks at once use a
region that starts inside the heading of such a section and ends inside
the heading of a sibling section of the same type.

   Besides staging and unstaging, Magit also provides several other
"apply variants" that can also operate on a file, multiple files at
once, a hunk, multiple hunks at once, and on parts of a hunk.  These
apply variants are described in the next section.

‘s’     (‘magit-stage’)

     Add the change at point to the staging area.

‘S’     (‘magit-stage-modified’)

     Stage all changes to files modified in the worktree.  Stage all new
     content of tracked files and remove tracked files that no longer
     exist in the working tree from the index also.  With a prefix
     argument also stage previously untracked (but not ignored) files.

‘u’     (‘magit-unstage’)

     Remove the change at point from the staging area.

‘U’     (‘magit-reset-index’)

     Reset the index to some commit.  The commit is read from the user
     and defaults to the commit at point.  If there is no commit at
     point, then it defaults to ‘HEAD’.

     So ‘U RET’ with no commit at point does the inverse of ‘S’ (or
     actually ‘S yes RET’), i.e.  "unstage all staged changes".  If you
     would rather use a command which always does just that, then rebind
     ‘U’ to ‘magit-unstage-all’.

‘M-x magit-unstage-all’     (‘magit-unstage-all’)

     Remove all changes from the staging area.

* Menu:

* Staging from file-visiting buffers::


File: magit.info,  Node: Staging from file-visiting buffers,  Up: Staging and unstaging

6.2.1 Staging from file-visiting buffers
----------------------------------------

Fine-grained un-/staging has to be done from the status or a diff
buffer, but it’s also possible to un-/stage all changes made to the file
visited in the current buffer right from inside that buffer.

‘M-x magit-stage-file’     (‘magit-stage-file’)

     When invoked inside a file-visiting buffer, then stage all changes
     to that file.  In a Magit buffer, stage the file at point if any.
     Otherwise prompt for a file to be staged.  With a prefix argument
     always prompt the user for a file, even in a file-visiting buffer
     or when there is a file section at point.

‘M-x magit-unstage-file’     (‘magit-unstage-file’)

     When invoked inside a file-visiting buffer, then unstage all
     changes to that file.  In a Magit buffer, unstage the file at point
     if any.  Otherwise prompt for a file to be unstaged.  With a prefix
     argument always prompt the user for a file, even in a file-visiting
     buffer or when there is a file section at point.


File: magit.info,  Node: Applying,  Next: Committing,  Prev: Staging and unstaging,  Up: Manipulating

6.3 Applying
============

Magit provides several "apply variants": stage, unstage, discard,
reverse, and "regular apply".  At least when operating on a hunk they
are all implemented using ‘git apply’, which is why they are called
"apply variants".

   • Stage.  Apply a change from the working tree to the index.  The
     change also remains in the working tree.

   • Unstage.  Remove a change from the index.  The change remains in
     the working tree.

   • Discard.  On a staged change, remove it from the working tree and
     the index.  On an unstaged change, remove it from the working tree
     only.

   • Reverse.  Reverse a change in the working tree.  Both committed and
     staged changes can be reversed.  Unstaged changes cannot be
     reversed.  Discard them instead.

   • Apply.  Apply a change to the working tree.  Both committed and
     staged changes can be applied.  Unstaged changes cannot be applied
     - as they already have been applied.

   The previous section described the staging and unstaging commands.
What follows are the commands which implement the remaining apply
variants.

‘a’     (‘magit-apply’)

     Apply the change at point to the working tree.

‘k’     (‘magit-discard’)

     Remove the change at point from the working tree.

‘v’     (‘magit-reverse’)

     Reverse the change at point in the working tree.

   With a prefix argument all apply variants attempt a 3-way merge when
appropriate (i.e.  when ‘git apply’ is used internally).

6.4 Committing
==============

When the user initiates a commit, Magit calls ‘git commit’ without any
arguments, so Git has to get it from the user.  It creates the file
‘.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG’ and then opens that file in an editor.  Magit
arranges for that editor to be the Emacsclient.  Once the user finishes
the editing session, the Emacsclient exits and Git creates the commit
using the file’s content as message.

6.4.1 Initiating a commit
-------------------------

Also see *note (gitman)git-commit:: .

‘c’     (‘magit-commit-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.

‘c c’     (‘magit-commit’)

     Create a new commit on ‘HEAD’.  With a prefix argument amend to the
     commit at ‘HEAD’ instead.

‘c a’     (‘magit-commit-amend’)

     Amend the last commit.

‘c e’     (‘magit-commit-extend’)

     Amend the last commit, without editing the message.  With a prefix
     argument change the committer date.  The option
     ‘magit-commit-extend-override-date’ can be used to inverse the
     meaning of the prefix argument.

‘c w’     (‘magit-commit-reword’)

     Reword the last commit, ignoring staged changes.

     With a prefix argument change the committer date.  The option
     ‘magit-commit-rewrite-override-date’ can be used to inverse the
     meaning of the prefix argument.

     Non-interactively respect the optional OVERRIDE-DATE argument and
     ignore the option.

‘c f’     (‘magit-commit-fixup’)

     Create a fixup commit.

     With a prefix argument the target commit has to be confirmed.
     Otherwise the commit at point may be used without confirmation
     depending on the value of option ‘magit-commit-squash-confirm’.

‘c F’     (‘magit-commit-instant-fixup’)

     Create a fixup commit and instantly rebase.

‘c s’     (‘magit-commit-squash’)

     Create a squash commit, without editing the squash message.

     With a prefix argument the target commit has to be confirmed.
     Otherwise the commit at point may be used without confirmation
     depending on the value of option ‘magit-commit-squash-confirm’.

‘c S’     (‘magit-commit-instant-squash’)

     Create a squash commit and instantly rebase.

‘c A’     (‘magit-commit-augment’)

     Create a squash commit, editing the squash message.

     With a prefix argument the target commit has to be confirmed.
     Otherwise the commit at point may be used without confirmation
     depending on the value of option ‘magit-commit-squash-confirm’.

 -- User Option: magit-commit-ask-to-stage

     Whether to ask to stage everything when committing and nothing is
     staged.

 -- User Option: magit-commit-extend-override-date

     Whether using ‘magit-commit-extend’ changes the committer date.

 -- User Option: magit-commit-reword-override-date

     Whether using ‘magit-commit-reword’ changes the committer date.

 -- User Option: magit-commit-squash-confirm

     Whether the commit targeted by squash and fixup has to be
     confirmed.  When non-nil then the commit at point (if any) is used
     as default choice.  Otherwise it has to be confirmed.  This option
     only affects ‘magit-commit-squash’ and ‘magit-commit-fixup’.  The
     "instant" variants always require confirmation because making an
     error while using those is harder to recover from.


File: magit.info,  Node: Editing commit messages,  Prev: Initiating a commit,  Up: Committing

6.4.2 Editing commit messages
-----------------------------

After initiating a commit as described in the previous section, two new
buffers appear.  One shows the changes that are about to committed,
while the other is used to write the message.  All regular editing
commands are available in the commit message buffer.  This section only
describes the additional commands.

   Commit messages are edited in an edit session - in the background Git
is waiting for the editor, in our case the Emacsclient, to save the
commit message in a file (in most cases ‘.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG’) and then
return.  If the Emacsclient returns with a non-zero exit status then Git
does not create the commit.  So the most important commands are those
for finishing and aborting the commit.

‘C-c C-c’     (‘with-editor-finish’)

     Finish the current editing session by returning with exit code 0.
     Git then creates the commit using the message it finds in the file.

‘C-c C-k’     (‘with-editor-cancel’)

     Cancel the current editing session by returning with exit code 1.
     Git then cancels the commit, but leaves the file untouched.

   In additon to being used by Git, these messages may also be stored in
a ring that persists until Emacs is closed.  By default the message is
stored at the beginning and the end of an edit session (regardless of
whether the session is finished successfully or was canceled).  It is
sometimes useful to bring back messages from that ring.

‘C-s M-s’     (‘git-commit-save-message’)

     Save the current buffer content to the commit message ring.

‘M-p’     (‘git-commit-prev-message’)

     Cycle backward through the commit message ring, after saving the
     current message to the ring.  With a numeric prefix ARG, go back
     ARG comments.

‘M-n’     (‘git-commit-next-message’)

     Cycle forward through the commit message ring, after saving the
     current message to the ring.  With a numeric prefix ARG, go back
     ARG comments.

   By default the diff for the changes that are about to be committed
are automatically shown when invoking the commit.  When amending to an
existing commit it may be useful to show either the changes that are
about to be added to that commit or to show those changes together with
those that are already committed.

‘C-c C-d’     (‘magit-diff-while-committing’)

     While committing, show the changes that are about to be committed.
     While amending, invoking the command again toggles between showing
     just the new changes or all the changes that will be committed.

   Some projects use pseudo headers in commit messages.  Magit colorizes
such headers and provides some commands to insert such headers.

 -- User Option: git-commit-known-pseudo-headers

     A list of Git pseudo headers to be highlighted.

‘C-c C-a’     (‘git-commit-ack’)

     Insert a header acknowledging that you have looked at the commit.

‘C-c C-r’     (‘git-commit-review’)

     Insert a header acknowledging that you have reviewed the commit.

‘C-c C-s’     (‘git-commit-signoff’)

     Insert a header to sign off the commit.

‘C-c C-t’     (‘git-commit-test’)

     Insert a header acknowledging that you have tested the commit.

‘C-c C-o’     (‘git-commit-cc’)

     Insert a header mentioning someone who might be interested.

‘C-c C-p’     (‘git-commit-reported’)

     Insert a header mentioning the person who reported the issue being
     fixed by the commit.

‘C-c C-i’     (‘git-commit-suggested’)

     Insert a header mentioning the person who suggested the change.

   ‘git-commit-mode’ is a minor mode that is only used to establish the
above key bindings.  This allows using an arbitrary major mode when
editing the commit message.  It’s even possible to use a different major
mode in different repositories, which is useful when different projects
impose different commit message conventions.

 -- User Option: git-commit-major-mode

     The value of this option is the major mode used to edit Git commit
     messages.

   Because ‘git-commit-mode’ is a minor mode, we don’t use its mode hook
to setup the buffer, except for the key bindings.  All other setup
happens in the function ‘git-commit-setup’, which among other things
runs the hook ‘git-commit-setup-hook’.  The following functions are
suitable for that hook.

 -- User Option: git-commit-setup-hook

     Hook run at the end of ‘git-commit-setup’.

 -- Function: magit-revert-buffers &optional force

     Revert unmodified file-visiting buffers of the current repository.

     If either ‘magit-revert-buffers’ is non-nil and
     ‘inhibit-magit-revert’ is nil, or if optional FORCE is non-nil,
     then revert all unmodified buffers that visit files being tracked
     in the current repository.

 -- Function: git-commit-save-message

     Save the current buffer content to the commit message ring.

 -- Function: git-commit-setup-changelog-support

     After this function is called, ChangeLog entries are treated as
     paragraphs.

 -- Function: git-commit-turn-on-auto-fill

     Turn on ‘auto-fill-mode’ and set ‘fill-column’ to the value of
     ‘git-commit-fill-column’.

 -- Function: git-commit-turn-on-flyspell

     Turn on Flyspell mode.  Also prevent comments from being checked
     and finally check current non-comment text.

 -- Function: git-commit-propertize-diff

     Propertize the diff shown inside the commit message buffer.  Git
     inserts such diffs into the commit message template when the
     ‘--verbose’ argument is used.  Magit’s commit popup by default does
     not offer that argument because the diff that is shown in a
     separate buffer is more useful.  But some users disagree, which is
     why this function exists.

 -- Function: with-editor-usage-message

     Show usage information in the echo area.

   Magit also helps with writing *good* commit messages by complaining
when certain rules are violated.

 -- User Option: git-commit-summary-max-length

     The intended maximal length of the summary line of commit messages.
     Characters beyond this column are colorized to indicate that this
     preference has been violated.

 -- User Option: git-commit-fill-column

     Column beyond which automatic line-wrapping should happen in commit
     message buffers.

 -- User Option: git-commit-finish-query-functions

     List of functions called to query before performing commit.

     The commit message buffer is current while the functions are
     called.  If any of them returns nil, then the commit is not
     performed and the buffer is not killed.  The user should then fix
     the issue and try again.

     The functions are called with one argument.  If it is non-nil then
     that indicates that the user used a prefix argument to force
     finishing the session despite issues.  Functions should usually
     honor this wish and return non-nil.

 -- Function: git-commit-check-style-conventions

     Check for violations of certain basic style conventions.  For each
     violation ask the user if she wants to proceed anyway.  This makes
     sure the summary line isn’t too long and that the second line is
     empty.

   To show no diff while committing remove ‘magit-commit-diff’ from
‘server-switch-hook’.

6.5 Branching
=============

Also see *note (gitman)git-branch:: and *note (gitman)git-checkout:: .

‘b’     (‘magit-branch-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.

‘b b’     (‘magit-checkout’)

     Checkout a revision read in the minibuffer and defaulting to the
     branch or arbitrary revision at point.  If the revision is a local
     branch then that becomes the current branch.  If it is something
     else then ‘HEAD’ becomes detached.  Checkout fails if the working
     tree or the staging area contain changes.

‘b c’     (‘magit-branch’)

     Create a new branch.  The user is asked for a branch or arbitrary
     revision to use as the starting point of the new branch.  When a
     branch name is provided, then that becomes the upstream branch of
     the new branch.  The name of the new branch is also read in the
     minibuffer.

‘b B’     (‘magit-branch-and-checkout’)

     This command creates a new branch like ‘magit-branch’, but then
     also checks it out.

‘b d’     (‘magit-branch-delete’)

     Delete one or multiple branches.  If the region marks multiple
     branches, then offer to delete those.  Otherwise, prompt for a
     single branch to be deleted, defaulting to the branch at point.

‘b u’     (‘magit-branch-set-upstream’)

     Change the upstream branch of a branch.  Both branches are read in
     the minibuffer, while providing reasonable defaults.

‘b U’     (‘magit-branch-unset-upstream’)

     Unset the upstream branch of a branch read in the minibuffer and
     defaulting to the branch at point or the current branch.

‘b r’     (‘magit-branch-rename’)

     Rename a branch.  The branch and the new name are read in the
     minibuffer.  With prefix argument the branch is renamed even if
     that name conflicts with an existing branch.

‘b e’     (‘magit-branch-edit-description’)

     Edit the description of a branch.  The branch is read in the
     minibuffer defaulting to the branch at point or the current branch.
     The description is edited in a regular buffer similar to how commit
     messages are edited.

 -- User Option: magit-branch-read-upstream-first

     When creating a branch, whether to read the upstream branch before
     the name of the branch that is to be created.

6.6 Merging
===========

Also see *note (gitman)git-merge:: .

‘m’     (‘magit-merge-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.

   When no merge is in progress, then the popup buffer features the
following commands.

‘m m’     (‘magit-merge’)

     Merge another branch or an arbitrary revision into the current
     branch.  The branch or revision to be merged is read in the
     minibuffer and defaults to the one at point.

     Unless there are conflicts or a prefix argument is used, the
     resulting merge commit uses a generic commit message, and the user
     does not get a chance to inspect or change it before the commit is
     created.  With a prefix argument this does not actually create the
     merge commit, which makes it possible to inspect how conflicts were
     resolved and to adjust the commit message.

‘m e’     (‘magit-merge-editmsg’)

     Merge another branch or an arbitrary revision into the current
     branch and open a commit message buffer, so that the user can make
     adjustments.  The commit is not actually created until the user
     finishes with ‘C-c C-c’.

‘m n’     (‘magit-merge-nocommit’)

     Merge another branch or an arbitrary revision into the current
     branch, but do not actually create the commit.  The user can then
     further adjust the merge, even when automatic conflict resolution
     succeeded and/or adjust the commit message.

‘m p’     (‘magit-merge-preview’)

     Preview result of merging another branch or an arbitrary revision
     into the current branch.

   When a merge is in progress, then the popup buffer features these
commands instead.

‘m m’     (‘magit-merge’)

     After resolving conflicts, proceed with the merge.  If there are
     still conflicts, then this fails.

‘m a’     (‘magit-merge-abort’)

     Abort the current merge operation.

6.7 Rebasing
============

Also see *note (gitman)git-rebase:: .

‘r’     (‘magit-rebase-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.

   When no rebase is in progress, then the popup buffer features the
following commands.

‘r r’     (‘magit-rebase’)

     Start a non-interactive rebase sequence.  All commits not in
     UPSTREAM are rebased.

‘r o’     (‘magit-rebase-subset’)

     Start a non-interactive rebase sequence with commits from START to
     ‘HEAD’ onto NEWBASE. START has to be selected from a list of recent
     commits.

‘r e’     (‘magit-rebase-interactive’)

     Start an interactive rebase sequence.

‘r l’     (‘magit-rebase-unpushed’)

     Start an interactive rebase sequence of unpushed commits.  This is
     like ‘magit-rebase-interactive’, but if the upstream of the current
     branch is configured, then all commits since the merge-base are
     rebased.  If there is no upstream or no merge-base, then the user
     has to select the first commit to be rebased like for
     ‘magit-rebase-interactive’.

‘r f’     (‘magit-rebase-autosquash’)

     Combine squash and fixup commits with their intended targets.

‘r s’     (‘magit-rebase-edit-commit’)

     Edit a single older commit using rebase.

‘r w’     (‘magit-rebase-reword-commit’)

     Reword a single older commit using rebase.

   When a rebase is in progress, then the popup buffer features these
commands instead.

‘r r’     (‘magit-rebase-continue’)

     Restart the current rebasing operation.

‘r s’     (‘magit-rebase-skip’)

     Skip the current commit and restart the current rebase operation.

‘r e’     (‘magit-rebase-edit’)

     Edit the todo list of the current rebase operation.

‘r a’     (‘magit-rebase-abort’)

     Abort the current rebase operation, restoring the original branch.

6.7.1 Editing rebase sequences
------------------------------

‘C-c C-c’     (‘with-editor-finish’)

     Finish the current editing session by returning with exit code 0.
     Git then creates the commit using the message it finds in the file.

‘C-c C-k’     (‘with-editor-cancel’)

     Cancel the current editing session by returning with exit code 1.
     Git then cancels the commit, but leaves the file untouched.

     Show the commit on the current line in another buffer and select
     that buffer.

‘SPC’     (‘magit-diff-show-or-scroll-up’)

     Show the commit on the current line in another buffer without
     selecting that buffer.  If the revision buffer is already visible
     in another window of the current frame, then instead scroll that
     window up.

‘DEL’     (‘magit-diff-show-or-scroll-down’)

     Show the commit on the current line in another buffer without

     window down.

‘p’     (‘git-rebase-backward-line’)

     Move to previous line.

‘n’     (‘forward-line’)

     Move to next line.

‘M-p’     (‘git-rebase-move-line-up’)

     Move the current commit (or command) down.

‘r’     (‘git-rebase-reword’)

     Edit message of commit on current line.

‘e’     (‘git-rebase-edit’)

     Stop at the commit on the current line.

‘s’     (‘git-rebase-squash’)

     Meld commit on current line into previous commit, and edit message.

‘f’     (‘git-rebase-fixup’)

     Meld commit on current line into previous commit, discarding the
     current commit’s message.

‘k’     (‘git-rebase-kill-line’)

     Kill the current action line.

‘c’     (‘git-rebase-pick’)

     Use commit on current line.

File: magit.info,  Node: Rebase sequence log,  Prev: Editing rebase sequences,  Up: Rebasing

6.7.2 Rebase sequence log
-------------------------

While a rebase sequence is in progress, the status buffer features a
section which lists the commits that have already been applied as well
as the commits that still have to be applied.

   The commits are split in two halves.  When rebase stops at a commit,
either because the user has to deal with a conflict or explicitly
requested that rebase stops at that commit, then point is placed on the
commit that separates the two groups, i.e.  on ‘HEAD’.  The commits
above it have not been applied yet, while it and the commits below it
have already been applied.  In between these two groups or applied and
yet-to-be applied commits, there sometimes is a commit which has been
dropped.

   Each commit is prefixed with a word and these words are additionally
shown in different colors to indicate the status of the commits.

   The following colors are used:

   • Yellow commits have not been applied yet.

   • Gray commits have already been applied.

   • The blue commit is the ‘HEAD’ commit.

   • The green commit is the commit the rebase sequence stopped at.  If
     this is the same commit as ‘HEAD’ (e.g.  because you haven’t done
     anything yet after rebase stopped at the commit, then this commit
     is shown in blue, not green.  There can only be a green and a blue
     commit at the same time, if you create one or more new commits
     after rebase stops at a commit.

   • Red commits have been dropped.  They are shown for reference only,
     e.g.  to make it easier to diff.

   Of course these colors are subject to the color-theme in use.

   The following words are used:

   • Commits prefixed with ‘pick’, ‘reword’, ‘edit’, ‘squash’, and
     ‘fixup’ have not been applied yet.  These words have the same
     meaning here as they do in the buffer used to edit the rebase
     sequence.  See *note Editing rebase sequences: Editing rebase
     sequences.

   • The commit prefixed with ‘onto’ is the commit on top of which all
     the other commits are being re-applied.  Like the commits that have
     already been re-applied, it is reachable from ‘HEAD’, but unlike
     those it has not actually been re-applied during the current
     session - it wasn’t touched at all.

   • Commits prefixed with ‘done’ have already been re-applied.  Not all
     commits that have already been applied are prefixed with this word,
     though.

   • When a commit is prefixed with ‘void’, then that indicates that
     Magit knows for sure that all the changes in that commit have been
     applied using several new commits.  This commit is no longer
     reachable from ‘HEAD’, and it also isn’t one of the commits that
     will be applied when resuming the session.

   • When a commit is prefixed with ‘join’, then that indicates that the
     rebase sequence stopped at that commit due to a conflict - you now
     have to join (merge) the changes with what has already been
     applied.  In a sense this is the commit rebase stopped at, but
     while its effect is already in the index and in the worktree (with
     conflict markers), the commit itself has not actually been applied
     yet (it isn’t the ‘HEAD’).  So it is shown in yellow, like the
     other commits that still have to be applied.

   • When a commit is prefixed with ‘goal’, ‘same’, or ‘work’, then that
     indicates that you reset to an earlier commit (and that this commit
     therefore is no longer reachable from ‘HEAD’), but that it might
     still be possible to create a new commit with the exact same tree
     or at least the same patch-id, without manually editing any file.
     Or at the very least that there are some uncommitted remaining,
     which may or may not originate from that commit.

        • When a commit is prefixed with ‘goal’, then that indicates
          that it is still possible to create a commit with the exact
          same tree (the "goal") without manually editing a file, by
          simply committing the index (or, provided nothing is already
          staged, by staging all unstaged changes and then committing
          that).  This is the case when the original tree exists in the
          index or worktree in untainted form.

        • When a commit is prefixed with ‘same’, then that indicates
          that it is no longer possible to create a commit with the
          exact same tree, but that it is still possible to create a
          commit with the same patch-id.  This would be the case if you
          created a new commit with other changes, but the changes from
          the original commit still exist in the index and/or working
          tree in untainted form.

        • When a commit is prefixed with ‘work’, then that indicates
          that you are working with the changes from that commit after
          resetting to an earlier commit.  There are changes in the
          index and/or working tree and some of them likely originate
          from that commit.

   • When a commit is prefixed with ‘poof’ or ‘gone’, then that
     indicates that you reset to an earlier commit (and that this commit
     therefore is no longer reachable from ‘HEAD’), and that there are
     no uncommitted changes remaining which might allow you to create a
     new commit with the same tree or at least the same patch-id.

        • When a commit is prefixed with ‘poof’, then that indicates
          that it is no longer reachable from ‘HEAD’, but that it has
          been replaced with one or more commits, which together have
          the exact same effect.

        • When a commit is prefixed with ‘gone’, then that indicates
          that it is no longer reachable from ‘HEAD’ and that we also
          cannot determine whether its changes are still in effect in
          one or more new commits.  They might be, but if so, then there
          must also be other changes which makes it impossible to know
          for sure.

   Do not worry if you do not fully understand the above.  That’s okay,
you will acquire a good enough understanding through practice.

   For other sequence operations such as cherry-picking, a similar
section is displayed, but they lack some of the features described
below, due to limitations in the git commands used to implement them.
Most importantly these sequences only support "picking" a commit but not
other actions such as "rewording", and they do not keep track of the
commits which have already been applied.

‘A’     (‘magit-cherry-pick-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.

   When no cherry-pick or revert is in progress, then the popup buffer
features the following commands.

‘A A’     (‘magit-cherry-pick’)

     Cherry-pick a commit.  Prompt for a commit, defaulting to the
     commit at point.  If the region selects multiple commits, then pick
     all of them, without prompting.

‘A a’     (‘magit-cherry-apply’)

     Apply the changes in a commit to the working tree, but do not
     commit them.  Prompt for a commit, defaulting to the commit at
     point.  If the region selects multiple commits, then apply all of
     them, without prompting.

     This command also has a top-level binding, which can be invoked
     without using the popup by typing ‘a’ at the top-level.

   When a cherry-pick or revert is in progress, then the popup buffer
features these commands instead.

‘A A’     (‘magit-sequence-continue’)

     Resume the current cherry-pick or revert sequence.

‘A s’     (‘magit-sequence-skip’)

     Skip the stopped at commit during a cherry-pick or revert sequence.

‘A a’     (‘magit-sequence-abort’)

     Abort the current cherry-pick or revert sequence.  This discards
     all changes made since the sequence started.

   When no cherry-pick or revert is in progress, then the popup buffer
features the following commands.

‘V V’     (‘magit-revert’)

     Revert a commit by creating a new commit.  Prompt for a commit,
     defaulting to the commit at point.  If the region selects multiple
     commits, then revert all of them, without prompting.

‘V v’     (‘magit-revert-no-commit’)

     Revert a commit by applying it in reverse to the working tree.
     Prompt for a commit, defaulting to the commit at point.  If the
     region selects multiple commits, then revert all of them, without
     prompting.

   When a cherry-pick or revert is in progress, then the popup buffer
features these commands instead.

‘V A’     (‘magit-sequence-continue’)

6.9 Resetting
=============

Also see *note (gitman)git-reset:: .

‘x’     (‘magit-reset’)

     Reset the head and index to some commit read from the user and
     defaulting to the commit at point.  The working tree is kept as-is.
     With a prefix argument also reset the working tree.

‘U’     (‘magit-reset-index’)

     Reset the index to some commit read from the user and defaulting to
     the commit at point.  Keep the ‘HEAD’ and working tree as-is, so if
     the commit refers to the ‘HEAD’, then this effectively unstages all
     changes.

‘M-x magit-reset-head’     (‘magit-reset-head’)

     Reset the ‘HEAD’ and index to some commit read from the user and
     defaulting to the commit at point.  The working tree is kept as-is.

‘M-x magit-reset-soft’     (‘magit-reset-soft’)

     Reset the ‘HEAD’ to some commit read from the user and defaulting

6.10 Stashing
=============

Also see *note (gitman)git-stash:: .

‘z’     (‘magit-stash-popup’)

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.

‘z z’     (‘magit-stash’)

     Create a stash of the index and working tree.  Untracked files are
     included according to popup arguments.  One prefix argument is
     equivalent to ‘--include-untracked’ while two prefix arguments are
     equivalent to ‘--all’.

‘z i’     (‘magit-stash-index’)

     Create a stash of the index only.  Unstaged and untracked changes
     are not stashed.

‘z w’     (‘magit-stash-worktree’)

     Create a stash of the working tree only.  Untracked files are
     included according to popup arguments.  One prefix argument is
     equivalent to ‘--include-untracked’ while two prefix arguments are
     equivalent to ‘--all’.

‘z x’     (‘magit-stash-keep-index’)

     Create a stash of the index and working tree, keeping index intact.
     Untracked files are included according to popup arguments.  One
     prefix argument is equivalent to ‘--include-untracked’ while two
     prefix arguments are equivalent to ‘--all’.

‘z Z’     (‘magit-snapshot’)

     Create a snapshot of the index and working tree.  Untracked files
     are included according to popup arguments.  One prefix argument is
     equivalent to ‘--include-untracked’ while two prefix arguments are
     equivalent to ‘--all’.

‘z I’     (‘magit-snapshot-index’)

     Create a snapshot of the index only.  Unstaged and untracked
     changes are not stashed.

‘z W’     (‘magit-snapshot-worktree’)

     Create a snapshot of the working tree only.  Untracked files are
     included according to popup arguments.  One prefix argument is
     equivalent to ‘--include-untracked’ while two prefix arguments are
     equivalent to ‘--all’-.

‘z a’     (‘magit-stash-apply’)

     Apply a stash to the working tree.  Try to preserve the stash
     index.  If that fails because there are staged changes, apply
     without preserving the stash index.

‘z p’     (‘magit-stash-pop’)

     Apply a stash to the working tree and remove it from stash list.
     Try to preserve the stash index.  If that fails because there are
     staged changes, apply without preserving the stash index and forgo
     removing the stash.

‘z d’     (‘magit-stash-drop’)

     Remove a stash from the stash list.  When the region is active,
     offer to drop all contained stashes.

‘z l’     (‘magit-stash-list’)

     List all stashes in a buffer.

‘z v’     (‘magit-stash-show’)

     Show all diffs of a stash in a buffer.

     This prefix command shows the following suffix commands along with
     the appropriate infix arguments in a popup buffer.

‘P P’     (‘magit-push-current’)

     Push the current branch to its upstream branch.  If the upstream
     isn’t set, then read the remote branch.

‘P o’     (‘magit-push’)

     Push a branch to its upstream branch.  If the upstream isn’t set,
     then read the remote branch.

‘P e’     (‘magit-push-elsewhere’)

     Push a branch or commit to some remote branch.  Read the local and
     remote branch.

‘P Q’     (‘magit-push-quickly’)

     Push the current branch to some remote.  When the Git variable
     ‘magit.pushRemote’ is set, then push to that remote.  If that
     variable is undefined or the remote does not exist, then push to
     "origin".  If that also doesn’t exist then raise an error.  The
     local branch is pushed to the remote branch with the same name.

‘P i’     (‘magit-push-implicitly’)

     Push without explicitly specifing what to push.  This runs ‘git
     push -v’.  What is being pushed depends on various Git variables as
     described in the *note (gitman)git-push:: and *note
     (gitman)git-config::

     manpages.

‘P m’     (‘magit-push-matching’)

     Push all matching branches to another repository.  If multiple
     remotes exit, then read one from the user.  If just one exists, use
     that without requiring confirmation.

‘P t’     (‘magit-push-tags’)

     Push all tags to another repository.  If only one remote exists,
     then push to that.  Otherwise prompt for a remote, offering the
     remote configured for the current branch as default.

‘P T’     (‘magit-push-tag’)

     Push a tag to another repository.

 -- User Option: magit-push-always-verify

     Whether certain commands require verification before pushing.

     Starting with ‘v2.1.0’ some of the push commands are supposed to
     push to the configured upstream branch without requiring user
     confirmation or offering to push somewhere else.

     This has taken a few users by surprise, and they suggested that we
     force users to opt-in to this behavior.  Unfortunately adding this
     option means that now other users will complain about us needlessly
     forcing them to set an option.  This is an attempt to make everyone
     happy and like all such attempts it is prone to fail.  Before
     complaining about having to set this option, please consider that
     other users are less experienced than you and have different needs.

     You should set the value of this option to nil, causing all push
     commands to behave as intended.  But first read the description of
     each command above.

‘T T’     (‘magit-notes-edit’)

     Edit the note attached to a commit, defaulting to the commit at
     point.

     By default use the value of Git variable ‘core.notesRef’ or
     "refs/notes/commits" if that is undefined.

‘T r’     (‘magit-notes-remove’)

     Remove the note attached to a commit, defaulting to the commit at

‘T p’     (‘magit-notes-prune’)

     Remove notes about unreachable commits.

‘T s’     (‘magit-notes-set-ref’)

     Set the current notes ref to a the value read from the user.  The
     ref is made current by setting the value of the Git variable
     ‘core.notesRef’.  With a prefix argument change the global value
     instead of the value in the current repository.  When this is
     undefined, then "refs/notes/commit" is used.

     Other ‘magit-notes-*’ commands, as well as the sub-commands of
     Git’s ‘note’ command, default to operate on that ref.

‘T S’     (‘magit-notes-set-display-refs’)

     Set notes refs to be display in addition to "core.notesRef".  This
     reads a colon separated list of notes refs from the user.  The
     values are stored in the Git variable ‘notes.displayRef’.  With a
     prefix argument GLOBAL change the global values instead of the
     values in the current repository.

   It is possible to merge one note ref into another.  That may result
in conflicts which have to resolved in the temporary worktree
".git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE".

File: magit.info,  Node: Wip modes,  Next: File-buffer mode,  Prev: Submodules,  Up: Miscellaneous

8.4 Wip modes
=============

Git keeps *committed* changes around long enough for users to recover
changes they have accidentally deleted.  It does so by not garbage
collecting any committed but no longer referenced objects for a certain
period of time, by default 30 days.

   But Git does *not* keep track of *uncommitted* changes in the working
tree and not even the index (the staging area).  Because Magit makes it
so convenient to modify uncommitted changes, it also makes it easy to
shoot yourself in the foot in the process.

   For that reason Magit provides three global modes that save *tracked*
files to work-in-progress references after or before certain actions.
(Untracked files are never saved and these modes also only work after
the first commit has been created).

   Two separate work-in-progress references are used to track the state
of the index and of the working tree: "refs/wip/index/<branchref>" and
"refs/wip/wtree/<branchref>", where ‘<branchref>’ is the full ref of the
current branch, e.g.  "refs/heads/master".  When the ‘HEAD’ is detached
then "HEAD" is in place of ‘<branchref>’.

   Checking out another branch (or detaching ‘HEAD’) causes the use of
different wip refs for subsequent changes, but the old refs are not
deleted.

   Creating a commit and then making a change causes the wip refs to be
recreated to fork from the new commit.  But the old commits on the wip
refs are not lost.  They are still available from the reflog.  To make
it easier to see when the fork point of a wip ref was changed, an
additional commit with the message "restart autosaving" is created on it
(‘xxO’ commits below are such boundary commits).

   Starting with

      BI0---BI1    refs/wip/index/refs/heads/master
     /
A---B              refs/heads/master
     \
      BW0---BW1    refs/wip/wtree/refs/heads/master

   and committing the staged changes and editing and saving a file would
result in

      BI0---BI1        refs/wip/index/refs/heads/master
     /
A---B---C              refs/heads/master
     \   \
      \   CW0---CW1    refs/wip/wtree/refs/heads/master
       \
        BW0---BW1      refs/wip/wtree/refs/heads/master@{2}

   The fork-point of the index wip ref is not changed until some change
is being staged.  Likewise just checking out a branch or creating a
commit does not change the fork-point of the working tree wip ref.  The
fork-points are not adjusted until there actually is a change that
should be committed to the respective wip ref.

   To view the log for the a branch and its wip refs use the commands
‘magit-wip-log’ and ‘magit-wip-log-current’.  You should use ‘--graph’
when using these commands.  Alternatively you can use the reflog to show
all commits that ever existed on a wip ref.  You can then recover lost
changes from the commits shown in the log or reflog.

 -- Command: magit-wip-log

     This command shows the log for a branch and its wip refs.

     With a negative prefix argument only the worktree wip ref is shown.
     The absolute numeric value of the prefix argument controls how many
     "branches" of each wip ref are shown.

 -- Command: magit-wip-log-current

     This command shows the log for the current branch and its wip refs.

     With a negative prefix argument only the worktree wip ref is shown.
     The absolute numeric value of the prefix argument controls how many
     "branches" of each wip ref are shown.

   There exists a total of three global modes that save to the wip refs,
which might seem excessive, but allows fine tuning of when exactly
changes are being committed to the wip refs.  Enabling all modes makes
it less likely that a change slips through the cracks.

   Setting the below variable directly does not take effect; either
customize them or call the respective mode function.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-after-save-mode

     When this mode is enabled, then saving a buffer that visits a file
     tracked in a Git repository causes its current state to be
     committed to the working tree wip ref for the current branch.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-after-apply-mode

     When this mode is enabled, then applying (i.e.  staging, unstaging,
     discarding, reversing, and regularly applying) a change to a file
     tracked in a Git repository causes its current state to be
     committed to the index and/or working tree wip refs for the current
     branch.

   If you only ever edit files using Emacs and only ever interact with
Git using Magit, then the above two modes should be enough to protect
each and every change from accidental loss.  In practice nobody does
that.  So an additional mode exists that does commit to the wip refs
before making changes that could cause the loss of earlier changes.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-before-change-mode

     When this mode is enabled, then certain commands commit the
     existing changes to the files they are about to make changes to.

   Note that even if you enable all three modes this won’t give you
perfect protection.  The most likely scenario for losing changes despite
the use of these modes is making a change outside Emacs and then
destroying it also outside Emacs.  In such a scenario, Magit, being an
Emacs package, didn’t get the opportunity to keep you from shooting
yourself in the foot.

   When you are unsure whether Magit did commit a change to the wip
refs, then you can explicitly request that all changes to all tracked
files are being committed.

‘M-x magit-wip-commit’     (‘magit-wip-commit’)

     This command commits all changes to all tracked files to the index
     and working tree work-in-progress refs.  Like the modes described
     above, it does not commit untracked files, but it does check all
     tracked files for changes.  Use this command when you suspect that
     the modes might have overlooked a change made outside Emacs/Magit.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-after-save-local-mode-lighter

     Mode-line lighter for ‘magit-wip-after-save-local-mode’.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-after-apply-mode-lighter

     Mode-line lighter for ‘magit-wip-after-apply-mode’.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-before-change-mode-lighter

     Mode-line lighter for ‘magit-wip-before-change-mode’.

 -- User Option: magit-wip-namespace

     The namespace used for work-in-progress refs.  It has to end with a
     slash.  The wip refs are named "<namespace>index/<branchref>" and
     "<namespace>wtree/<branchref>".  When snapshots are created while
     the ‘HEAD’ is detached then "HEAD" is used in place of
     ‘<branchref>’.

8.5 File-buffer mode
====================

The ‘magit-file-buffer-mode’ enables certain Magit features in
file-visiting buffers belonging to a Git repository.  It should be
enabled globally using ‘global-magit-file-buffer-mode’.  Currently this
mode only establishes a few key bindings, but this might be extended in
the future.

 -- User Option: global-magit-file-buffer-mode

     Whether to establish certain Magit key bindings in all
     file-visiting buffers belonging to a Git repository.  This
     establishes the bindings suggested in *note Getting started:
     Getting started. (but only for file-visiting buffers), and
     additionally binds ‘C-c M-g’ to ‘magit-file-buffer-popup’.

 -- Command: magit-file-buffer-popup

     This prefix command shows a popup buffer featuring suffix commands
     that operate on the file being visited in the current buffer.

9 Customizing
*************

Both Git and Emacs are highly customizable.  Magit is both a Git
porcelain as well as an Emacs package, so it makes sense to customize it
using both Git variables as well as Emacs options.  However this
flexibility doesn’t come without problems, including but not limited to
the following.

   • Some Git variables automatically have an effect in Magit without
     requiring any explicit support.  Sometimes that is desirable - in
     other cases, it breaks Magit.

     When a certain Git setting breaks Magit but you want to keep using
     that setting on the command line, then that can be accomplished by
     overriding the value for Magit only by appending something like
     ‘("-c" "some.variable=compatible-value")’ to
     ‘magit-git-global-arguments’.

   • Certain settings like ‘fetch.prune=true’ are respected by Magit
     commands (because they simply call the respective Git command) but
     their value is not reflected in the respective popup buffers.  In
     this case the ‘--prune’ argument in ‘magit-fetch-popup’ might be
     active or inactive depending on the value of
     ‘magit-fetch-arguments’ only, but that doesn’t keep the Git
     variable from being honored by the suffix commands anyway.  So
     pruning might happen despite the the ‘--prune’ arguments being
     displayed in a way that seems to indicate that no pruning will
     happen.

   I intend to address these and similar issues in a future release.

File: magit.info,  Node: Per-repository configuration,  Next: Essential settings,  Up: Customizing

9.1 Per-repository configuration
================================

Magit can be configured on a per-repository level using both Git
variables as well as Emacs options.

   To set a Git variable for one repository only, simply set it in
‘/path/to/repo/.git/config’ instead of ‘$HOME/.gitconfig’ or
‘/etc/gitconfig’.  See *note (gitman)git-config:: .

   Similarly, Emacs options can be set for one repository only by
editing ‘/path/to/repo/.dir-locals.el’.  See *note (emacs)Directory
Variables::.  For example to disable automatic refreshes of
file-visiting buffers in just one huge repository use this:

   • ‘/path/to/huge/repo/.dir-locals.el’

          ((nil . ((magit-refresh-buffers . nil))

   If you want to apply the same settings to several, but not all,
repositories then keeping the repository-local config files in sync
would quickly become annoying.  To avoid that you can create config
files for certain classes of repositories (e.g.  "huge repositories")
and then include those files in the per-repository config files.  For
example:

   • ‘/path/to/huge/repo/.git/config’

          [include]
                  path = /path/to/huge-gitconfig

   • ‘/path/to/huge-gitconfig’

9.2.1 Safety
------------

This section discusses various variables that you might want to change
(or *not* change) for safety reasons.

   Git keeps *committed* changes around long enough for users to recover
changes they have accidentally deleted.  It does not do the same for
*uncommitted* changes in the working tree and not even the index (the
staging area).  Because Magit makes it so easy to modify uncommitted
changes, it also makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot in the
process.  For that reason Magit provides three global modes that save
*tracked* files to work-in-progress references after or before certain
actions.  See *note Wip modes: Wip modes.

   These modes are not enabled by default because of performance
concerns.  Instead a lot of potentially destructive commands require
confirmation every time they are used.  In many cases this can be
disabled by adding a symbol to ‘magit-no-confirm’ (see *note Completion
and confirmation: Completion and confirmation.).  If you enable the
various wip modes then you should add ‘safe-with-wip’ to this list.

   Similarly it isn’t necessary to require confirmation before moving a
file to the system trash - if you trashed a file by mistake then you can
recover it from the there.  Option ‘magit-delete-by-moving-to-trash’
controls whether the system trash is used, which is the case by default.
Nevertheless, ‘trash’ isn’t a member of ‘magit-no-confirm’ - you might
want to change that.

   Buffers visiting files tracked in the current repository are being
refreshed before certain actions.  See *note Automatic refresh and
revert: Automatic refresh and revert.  This isn’t as risky as it might
seem.  If a buffer is modified (i.e.  it contains changes that haven’t
been saved yet), then Emacs/Magit would refuse to revert it.  If the
buffer has been saved resulting in what is seen by Git as an uncommitted
change, then Git in turn would refuse to carry out the action that would
cause these changes to be lost.  Since Git doesn’t do anything, the file
doesn’t change on disk, and Emacs/Magit has nothing to revert.

   However if you do modify some files, visit the respective files in
Emacs, somehow discard the changes (not using Magit and probably even
outside Emacs), and then expect the respective file-visiting buffers to
retain the uncommitted changes, then the automatic reverting would
actually be harmful.  In other words if you use file-visiting buffers as
a sort of "staging area", then you should set ‘magit-revert-buffers’ to
‘nil’.

   So far I have only heard from one user who uses such a workflow.  But
because there might be some other users doing such things, and I don’t
want to be responsible for data loss, these reverts by default happen
quite verbosely, allowing these few users to undo the reverts using the
‘undo’ command and then disabling the automatic reverts for the future.
Most users should however keep automatic reverts turned on and instead
configure it to be less verbose by setting ‘magit-revert-buffers’ to ‘t’
or even ‘silent’.


File: magit.info,  Node: Performance,  Prev: Safety,  Up: Essential settings

9.2.2 Performance
-----------------

Magit is slower than raw Git because it does more.  For example ‘git
commit’ creates a commit and that’s it.  ‘magit-commit’ also updates the
current Magit buffer to make sure you are not looking at outdated
information without noticing it.  To refresh the status buffer, Magit
has to run Git a dozen times or more, making it slower than ‘git
status’, but also much more informative.  Magit also optionally reverts
file-visiting buffers, creates backups, runs hooks where third-party
extensions can do their slow thing, etc.

   I do care about performance and try to optimize for it as much as
possible, but many features simply come with an inherent performance
penalty.  When a feature is just too slow given certain usage and
repository characteristics, then it often can be disabled, globally or
on a per-repository basis.

   But first a short list of performance issues that cannot easily be
worked around:

   • Creating a new process on MS Windows is much slower than on
     POSIX-compatible systems.  This is a problem because Magit creates
     a lot of child processes to retrieve information from Git.  In the
     short run, only switching to a POSIX system can fix this.  Of
     course this could also be fixed in Windows itself, but I am just
     one unpaid person while Microsoft is a billion dollar company, so I
     will leave it to them to fix this grave flaw in their OS.

   • When showing logs, Magit limits the number of commits initially
     shown in the hope that this avoids unnecessary work.  When using
     ‘--graph’ this unfortunately does not have the desired effect for
     large histories.  Junio said on the git mailing list
     (<http://www.spinics.net/lists/git/msg232230.html>): "‘--graph’
     wants to compute the whole history and the max-count only affects
     the output phase after ‘--graph’ does its computation".

     In other words, it’s not that Git is slow at outputting the
     differences, or that Magit is slow at parsing the output - the
     problem is that Git first goes outside and has a smoke.  This has
     to be fixed in Git but so far nobody volunteered to do it.  Maybe
     you could do that?

   • Whenever "something changes", Magit "refreshes" the status buffer
     and the current Magit buffer by recreating them from scratch.  This
     is an old design decision that we couldn’t depart from easily.  And
     it has its benefits too - most importantly it’s much simpler and
     less error prone to do it this way than to only refreshing "what
     actually has changed" (that would basically be a huge collection of
     special cases).  So for now at least, we don’t avoid recreating the
     buffer content and instead focus on making doing so faster.

   Now for the things that you can do to improve performance:

   Most optional features which can have a negative effect on
performance are disabled by default.  So start by checking the options
you have customized.  Even the potentially slow features are expected to
only lead to barely noticeable delays, but your mileage may vary.  Also
note that it is now possible to set options on a per-repository or
per-repository-class basis.  See *note Per-repository configuration:
Per-repository configuration.

   You should check the values of at least the following variables:

   • ‘magit-after-revert-hook’

   • ‘magit-diff-auto-show’

   • ‘magit-diff-highlight-hunk-body’

   • ‘magit-diff-highlight-indentation’

   • ‘magit-diff-highlight-trailing’

   • ‘magit-diff-paint-whitespace’

   • ‘magit-diff-refine-hunk’

   • ‘magit-log-arguments’, ‘magit-log-select-arguments’, and
     ‘magit-log-section-arguments’

     In repositories with more than a few thousand commits ‘--graph’
     should never be a member of ‘magit-log-section-arguments’.  That
     variable is in the status buffer which is refreshed every time you
     run any Magit command.

     Using ‘--color --graph’ is even slower.  Magit uses code that is
     part of Emacs to turn control characters into faces.  That code is
     pretty slow and this is quite noticeable when showing a log with
     many branches and merges.  For that reason ‘--color’ is not enabled
     by default anymore.  Consider leaving it at that.

   • ‘magit-not-reverted-hook’

   • ‘magit-refresh-buffer-hook’

   • ‘magit-refs-sections-hook’

     When refreshing the "references buffer" is slow, then that’s
     usually because several hundred refs are being displayed.  The best
     way to address that is to display fewer refs, obviously.

     If you are not, or only mildly, interested in seeing the list of
     tags, then start by not displaying them:

          (remove-hook 'magit-refs-sections-hook 'magit-insert-tags)

     Then you should also make sure that the listed remote branches
     actually all exist.  You can do so by pruning branches which no
     longer exist using ‘f-pa’.

   • ‘magit-status-refresh-hook’

   • ‘magit-wip-after-apply-mode’

   • ‘magit-wip-after-save-mode’

   • ‘magit-wip-before-change-mode’

   Also note that everything involving "cherry commits" is slow.

   If, after actually trying the above suggestions, performance is still
bad, and the above does not contain a statement explaining why that is
so in that particular case and that there is nothing that we can
currently do about it, then comment on the appropriate existing issue
(see <https://github.com/magit/magit/labels/performance>), or if
necessary open a new issue.  Note that "something is slow, I am using
v2.2" is not helpful, you have to be a bit more specific.  Benchmarks
are a start.

***********

The following sections describe how to use several of Magit’s core
abstractions to extend Magit itself or implement a separate extension.

   A few of the low-level features used by Magit have been factored out
into separate libraries/packages, so that they can be used by other
packages, without having to depend on Magit.  These libraries are
described in separate manuals, see *note (with-editor)Top:: and *note
(magit-popup)Top::.

File: magit.info,  Node: Calling Git,  Next: Section plumbing,  Up: Plumbing

10.1 Calling Git
================

Magit provides many specialized functions for calling Git.  All of these
functions are defined in either ‘magit-git.el’ or ‘magit-process.el’ and
have one of the prefixes ‘magit-run-’, ‘magit-call-’, ‘magit-start-’, or
‘magit-git-’ (which is also used for other things).

   All of these functions accept an indefinite number of arguments,
which are strings that specify command line arguments for git (or in
some cases an arbitrary executable).  These arguments are flattened
before being passed on to the executable; so instead of strings they can
also be lists of strings and arguments that are ‘nil’ are silently
dropped.  Some of these functions also require a single mandatory
argument before these command line arguments.

   Roughly speaking these functions run Git either to get some value or
for side-effect.  The functions that return a value are useful to
collect the information necessary to populate a Magit buffer, while the
others are used to implement Magit commands.

   The functions in the value-only group always run synchronously, and
they never trigger a refresh.  The function in the side-effect group can
be further divided into subgroups depending on whether they run Git
synchronously or asynchronously, and depending on whether they trigger a
refresh when the executable has finished.

File: magit.info,  Node: Getting a value from Git,  Next: Calling Git for effect,  Up: Calling Git

10.1.1 Getting a value from Git
-------------------------------

These functions run Git in order to get a value, either its exit status
or its output.  Of course you could also use them to run Git commands
that have side-effects, but that should be avoided.

 -- Function: magit-git-exit-code &rest args

     Executes git with ARGS and returns its exit code.

 -- Function: magit-git-success &rest args

     Executes git with ARGS and returns ‘t’ if the exit code is ‘0’,
     ‘nil’ otherwise.

 -- Function: magit-git-failure &rest args

     Executes git with ARGS and returns ‘t’ if the exit code is ‘1’,
     ‘nil’ otherwise.

 -- Function: magit-git-true &rest args

     Executes git with ARGS and returns ‘t’ if the first line printed by
     git is the string "true", ‘nil’ otherwise.

 -- Function: magit-git-false &rest args

     Executes git with ARGS and returns ‘t’ if the first line printed by
     git is the string "false", ‘nil’ otherwise.

 -- Function: magit-git-insert &rest args

     Executes git with ARGS and inserts its output at point.

 -- Function: magit-git-string &rest args

     Executes git with ARGS and returns the first line of its output.
     If there is no output or if it begins with a newline character,
     then this returns ‘nil’.

 -- Function: magit-git-lines &rest args

     Executes git with ARGS and returns its output as a list of lines.
     Empty lines anywhere in the output are omitted.

 -- Function: magit-git-items &rest args

     Executes git with ARGS and returns its null-separated output as a
     list.  Empty items anywhere in the output are omitted.

     If the value of option ‘magit-git-debug’ is non-nil and git exits
     with a non-zero exit status, then warn about that in the echo area
     and add a section containing git’s standard error in the current
     repository’s process buffer.

   When an error occurs when using one of the above functions, then that
is usually due to a bug, i.e.  the use of an argument which is not
actually supported.  Such errors are usually not reported, but when they
occur we need to be able to debug them.

 -- User Option: magit-git-debug

     Whether to report errors that occur when using ‘magit-git-insert’,
     ‘magit-git-string’, ‘magit-git-lines’, or ‘magit-git-items’.  This
     does not actually raise an error.  Instead a message is shown in
     the echo area, and git’s standard error is insert into a new
     section in the current repository’s process buffer.

 -- Function: magit-git-str &rest args

     This is a variant of ‘magit-git-string’ that ignores the option
     ‘magit-git-debug’.  It is mainly intended to be used while handling
     errors in functions that do respect that option.  Using such a
     function while handing an error could cause yet another error and
     therefore lead to an infinite recursion.  You probably won’t ever
     need to use this function.


File: magit.info,  Node: Calling Git for effect,  Prev: Getting a value from Git,  Up: Calling Git

10.1.2 Calling Git for effect
-----------------------------

These functions are used to run git to produce some effect.  Most Magit
commands that actually run git do so by using such a function.

   Because we do not need to consume git’s output when using these
functions, their output is instead logged into a per-repository buffer,
which can be shown using ‘$’ from a Magit buffer or ‘M-x magit-process’
elsewhere.

   These functions can have an effect in two distinct ways.  Firstly,
running git may change something, i.e.  create or push a new commit.
Secondly, that change may require that Magit buffers are refreshed to
reflect the changed state of the repository.  But refreshing isn’t
always desirable, so only some of these functions do perform such a
refresh after git has returned.

   Sometimes it is useful to run git asynchronously.  For example, when
the user has just initiated a push, then there is no reason to make her
wait until that has completed.  In other cases it makes sense to wait
for git to complete before letting the user do something else.  For
example after staging a change it is useful to wait until after the
refresh because that also automatically moves to the next change.

 -- Function: magit-call-git &rest args

     Calls git synchronously with ARGS.

 -- Function: magit-call-process program &rest args

     Calls PROGRAM synchronously with ARGS.

 -- Function: magit-run-git &rest args

     Calls git synchronously with ARGS and then refreshes.

 -- Function: magit-run-git-with-input input &rest args

     Calls git synchronously with ARGS and sends it INPUT on standard
     input.

     INPUT should be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer.  The
     content of that buffer is used as the process’ standard input.
     After the process returns a refresh is performed.

     As a special case, INPUT may also be nil.  In that case the content
     of the current buffer is used as standard input and *no* refresh is
     performed.

     This function actually runs git asynchronously.  But then it waits
     for the process to return, so the function itself is synchronous.

 -- Function: magit-run-git-with-logfile file &rest args

     Calls git synchronously with ARGS. The process’ output is saved in
     FILE. This is rarely useful and so this function might be removed
     in the future.

     This function actually runs git asynchronously.  But then it waits
     for the process to return, so the function itself is synchronous.

 -- Function: magit-git &rest args

     Calls git synchronously with ARGS for side-effects only.  This
     function does not refresh the buffer.

 -- Function: magit-git-wash washer &rest args

     Execute Git with ARGS, inserting washed output at point.  Actually
     first insert the raw output at point.  If there is no output call
     ‘magit-cancel-section’.  Otherwise temporarily narrow the buffer to
     the inserted text, move to its beginning, and then call function
     WASHER with no argument.

   And now for the asynchronous variants.

 -- Function: magit-run-git-async &rest args

     Start Git, prepare for refresh, and return the process object.
     ARGS is flattened and then used as arguments to Git.

     Display the command line arguments in the echo area.

     After Git returns some buffers are refreshed: the buffer that was
     current when this function was called (if it is a Magit buffer and
     still alive), as well as the respective Magit status buffer.
     Unmodified buffers visiting files that are tracked in the current
     repository are reverted if ‘magit-revert-buffers’ is non-nil.

 -- Function: magit-run-git-with-editor &rest args

     Export GIT_EDITOR and start Git.  Also prepare for refresh and
     return the process object.  ARGS is flattened and then used as
     arguments to Git.

     Display the command line arguments in the echo area.

     After Git returns some buffers are refreshed: the buffer that was
     current when this function was called (if it is a Magit buffer and
     still alive), as well as the respective Magit status buffer.

 -- Function: magit-start-git &rest args

     Start Git, prepare for refresh, and return the process object.

     If INPUT is non-nil, it has to be a buffer or the name of an
     existing buffer.  The buffer content becomes the processes standard
     input.

     Option ‘magit-git-executable’ specifies the Git executable and
     option ‘magit-git-global-arguments’ specifies constant arguments.
     The remaining arguments ARGS specify arguments to Git.  They are
     flattened before use.

     After Git returns, some buffers are refreshed: the buffer that was
     current when this function was called (if it is a Magit buffer and
     still alive), as well as the respective Magit status buffer.
     Unmodified buffers visiting files that are tracked in the current
     repository are reverted if ‘magit-revert-buffers’ is non-nil.

 -- Function: magit-start-process &rest args

     Start PROGRAM, prepare for refresh, and return the process object.

     If optional argument INPUT is non-nil, it has to be a buffer or the
     name of an existing buffer.  The buffer content becomes the
     processes standard input.

     The process is started using ‘start-file-process’ and then setup to
     use the sentinel ‘magit-process-sentinel’ and the filter
     ‘magit-process-filter’.  Information required by these functions is
     stored in the process object.  When this function returns the
     process has not started to run yet so it is possible to override
     the sentinel and filter.

     After the process returns, ‘magit-process-sentinel’ refreshes the
     buffer that was current when ‘magit-start-process’ was called (if
     it is a Magit buffer and still alive), as well as the respective
     Magit status buffer.  Unmodified buffers visiting files that are
     tracked in the current repository are reverted if
     ‘magit-revert-buffers’ is non-nil.

 -- Variable: magit-this-process

     The child process which is about to start.  This can be used to
     change the filter and sentinel.

 -- Variable: magit-process-raise-error

     When this is non-nil, then ‘magit-process-sentinel’ raises an error
     if git exits with a non-zero exit status.  For debugging purposes.

* Matching sections::


File: magit.info,  Node: Creating sections,  Next: Section selection,  Up: Section plumbing

10.2.1 Creating sections
------------------------

 -- Macro: magit-insert-section &rest args

     Insert a section at point.

     TYPE is the section type, a symbol.  Many commands that act on the
     current section behave differently depending on that type.  Also if
     a variable ‘magit-TYPE-section-map’ exists, then use that as the
     text-property ‘keymap’ of all text belonging to the section (but
     this may be overwritten in subsections).

     Optional VALUE is the value of the section, usually a string that
     is required when acting on the section.

     When optional HIDE is non-nil collapse the section body by default,
     i.e.  when first creating the section, but not when refreshing the
     buffer.  Otherwise, expand it by default.  This can be overwritten
     using ‘magit-section-set-visibility-hook’.  When a section is
     recreated during a refresh, then the visibility of predecessor is
     inherited and HIDE is ignored (but the hook is still honored).

     BODY is any number of forms that actually insert the section’s
     heading and body.  Optional NAME, if specified, has to be a symbol,
     which is then bound to the struct of the section being inserted.

     Before BODY is evaluated the ‘start’ of the section object is set
     to the value of ‘point’ and after BODY was evaluated its ‘end’ is
     set to the new value of ‘point’; BODY is responsible for moving
     ‘point’ forward.

     If it turns out inside BODY that the section is empty, then
     ‘magit-cancel-section’ can be used to abort and remove all traces
     of the partially inserted section.  This can happen when creating a
     section by washing Git’s output and Git didn’t actually output
     anything this time around.

 -- Function: magit-insert-heading &rest args

     Insert the heading for the section currently being inserted.

     This function should only be used inside ‘magit-insert-section’.

     When called without any arguments, then just set the ‘content’ slot
     of the object representing the section being inserted to a marker
     at ‘point’.  The section should only contain a single line when
     this function is used like this.

     When called with arguments ARGS, which have to be strings, then
     insert those strings at point.  The section should not contain any
     text before this happens and afterwards it should again only
     contain a single line.  If the ‘face’ property is set anywhere
     inside any of these strings, then insert all of them unchanged.
     Otherwise use the ‘magit-section-heading’ face for all inserted
     text.

     The ‘content’ property of the section struct is the end of the
     heading (which lasts from ‘start’ to ‘content’) and the beginning
     of the body (which lasts from ‘content’ to ‘end’).  If the value of
     ‘content’ is nil, then the section has no heading and its body
     cannot be collapsed.  If a section does have a heading then its
     height must be exactly one line, including a trailing newline
     character.  This isn’t enforced; you are responsible for getting it
     right.  The only exception is that this function does insert a
     newline character if necessary.

 -- Function: magit-cancel-section

     Cancel the section currently being inserted.  This exits the
     innermost call to ‘magit-insert-section’ and removes all traces of
     what has already happened inside that call.

 -- Function: magit-define-section-jumper sym title &optional value

     Define an interactive function to go to section SYM. TITLE is the
     displayed title of the section.

10.2.2 Section selection
------------------------

 -- Function: magit-current-section

     Return the section at point.

 -- Function: magit-region-sections

     Return a list of the selected sections.

     When the region is active and constitutes a valid section
     selection, then return a list of all selected sections.  This is
     the case when the region begins in the heading of a section and
     ends in the heading of a sibling of that first section.  When the
     selection is not valid then return nil.  Most commands that can act
     on the selected sections, then instead just act on the current
     section, the one point is in.

     When the region looks like it would in any other buffer then the
     selection is invalid.  When the selection is valid then the region
     uses the ‘magit-section-highlight’.  This does not apply to diffs
     where things get a bit more complicated, but even here if the
     region looks like it usually does, then that’s not a valid
     selection as far as this function is concerned.

 -- Function: magit-region-values &rest types

     Return a list of the values of the selected sections.

     Also see ‘magit-region-sections’ whose doc-string explains when a
     region is a valid section selection.  If the region is not active
     or is not a valid section selection, then return nil.  If optional
     TYPES is non-nil then the selection not only has to be valid; the
     types of all selected sections additionally have to match one of
     TYPES, or nil is returned.

10.2.3 Matching sections
------------------------

‘M-x magit-describe-section’     (‘magit-describe-section’)

     Show information about the section at point.  This command is
     intended for debugging purposes.

 -- Function: magit-section-ident

     Return an unique identifier for SECTION. The return value has the
     form ‘((TYPE . VALUE)...)’.

 -- Function: magit-get-section

     Return the section identified by IDENT. IDENT has to be a list as
     returned by ‘magit-section-ident’.

 -- Function: magit-section-match condition &optional section

     Return ‘t’ if SECTION matches CONDITION. SECTION defaults to the
     section at point.

     Conditions can take the following forms:
        • ‘(CONDITION...)’

          matches if any of the CONDITIONs matches.

        • ‘[TYPE...]’

          matches if the first TYPE matches the type of the section at
          point, the second matches that of its parent, and so on.

        • ‘[* TYPE...]’

          matches sections that match [TYPE…] and also recursively all
          their child sections.

        • ‘TYPE’

          matches TYPE regardless of its parents.
     Each TYPE is a symbol.  Note that is not necessary to specify all
     TYPEs up to the root section as printed by ‘magit-describe-type’,
     unless of course your want to be that precise.

 -- Function: magit-section-when condition &rest body

     If the section at point matches CONDITION evaluate BODY.

     If the section matches evaluate BODY forms sequentially and return
     the value of the last one, or if there are no BODY forms return the
     value of the section.  If the section does not match return nil.

     See ‘magit-section-match’ for the forms CONDITION can take.

 -- Function: magit-section-case &rest clauses

     Choose among clauses on the type of the section at point.

     Each clause looks like (CONDITION BODY…).  The type of the section
     is compared against each CONDITION; the BODY forms of the first
     match are evaluated sequentially and the value of the last form is
     returned.  Inside BODY the symbol ‘it’ is bound to the section at
     point.  If no clause succeeds or if there is no section at point
     return nil.

     See ‘magit-section-match’ for the forms CONDITION can take.
     Additionally a CONDITION of t is allowed in the final clause and
     matches if no other CONDITION match, even if there is no section at
     point.

 -- Variable: magit-root-section

     The root section in the current buffer.  All other sections are
     descendants of this section.  The value of this variable is set by
     ‘magit-insert-section’ and you should never modify it.

   For diff related sections a few additional tools exist.

 -- Function: magit-diff-type &optional section

     Return the diff type of SECTION.

     The returned type is one of the symbols ‘staged’, ‘unstaged’,
     ‘committed’, or ‘undefined’.  This type serves a similar purpose as
     the general type common to all sections (which is stored in the
     ‘type’ slot of the corresponding ‘magit-section’ struct) but takes
     additional information into account.  When the SECTION isn’t
     related to diffs and the buffer containing it also isn’t a
     diff-only buffer, then return nil.

     Currently the type can also be one of ‘tracked’ and ‘untracked’,
     but these values are not handled explicitly in every place they
     should be.  A possible fix could be to just return nil here.

     The section has to be a ‘diff’ or ‘hunk’ section, or a section
     whose children are of type ‘diff’.  If optional SECTION is nil,
     return the diff type for the current section.  In buffers whose
     major mode is ‘magit-diff-mode’ SECTION is ignored and the type is
     determined using other means.  In ‘magit-revision-mode’ buffers the
     type is always ‘committed’.

 -- Function: magit-diff-scope &optional section strict

     Return the diff scope of SECTION or the selected section(s).

     A diff’s "scope" describes what part of a diff is selected, it is a
     symbol, one of ‘region’, ‘hunk’, ‘hunks’, ‘file’, ‘files’, or
     ‘list’.  Do not confuse this with the diff "type", as returned by
     ‘magit-diff-type’.

     If optional SECTION is non-nil, then return the scope of that,
     ignoring the sections selected by the region.  Otherwise return the
     scope of the current section, or if the region is active and
     selects a valid group of diff related sections, the type of these
     sections, i.e.  ‘hunks’ or ‘files’.  If SECTION (or if the current
     section that is nil) is a ‘hunk’ section and the region starts and
     ends inside the body of a that section, then the type is ‘region’.

     If optional STRICT is non-nil then return nil if the diff type of
     the section at point is ‘untracked’ or the section at point is not
     actually a ‘diff’ but a ‘diffstat’ section.

10.3 Refreshing buffers
=======================

All commands that create a new Magit buffer or change what is being
displayed in an existing buffer do so by calling ‘magit-mode-setup’.
Among other things, that function sets the buffer local values of
‘default-directory’ (to the top-level of the repository),
‘magit-refresh-function’, and ‘magit-refresh-args’.

   Buffers are refreshed by calling the function that is the local value
of ‘magit-refresh-function’ (a function named ‘magit-*-refresh-buffer’,
where ‘*’ may be something like ‘diff’) with the value of
‘magit-refresh-args’ as arguments.

 -- Macro: magit-mode-setup buffer switch-func mode refresh-func
          &optional refresh-args

     This function displays and selects BUFFER, turns on MODE, and
     refreshes a first time.

     This function displays and optionally selects BUFFER by calling
     ‘magit-mode-display-buffer’ with BUFFER, MODE and SWITCH-FUNC as
     arguments.  Then it sets the local value of
     ‘magit-refresh-function’ to REFRESH-FUNC and that of
     ‘magit-refresh-args’ to REFRESH-ARGS. Finally it creates the buffer
     content by calling REFRESH-FUNC with REFRESH-ARGS as arguments.

     All arguments are evaluated before switching to BUFFER.

 -- Function: magit-mode-display-buffer buffer mode &optional
          switch-function

     This function display BUFFER in some window and select it.  BUFFER
     may be a buffer or a string, the name of a buffer.  The buffer is
     returned.

     Unless BUFFER is already displayed in the selected frame, store the
     previous window configuration as a buffer local value, so that it
     can later be restored by ‘magit-mode-bury-buffer’.

     The buffer is displayed and selected using SWITCH-FUNCTION. If that
     is ‘nil’ then ‘pop-to-buffer’ is used if the current buffer’s major
     mode derives from ‘magit-mode’.  Otherwise ‘switch-to-buffer’ is
     used.

 -- Variable: magit-refresh-function

     The value of this buffer-local variable is the function used to
     refresh the current buffer.  It is called with ‘magit-refresh-args’
     as arguments.

 -- Variable: magit-refresh-args

     The list of arguments used by ‘magit-refresh-function’ to refresh
     the current buffer.  ‘magit-refresh-function’ is called with these
     arguments.

     The value is usually set using ‘magit-mode-setup’, but in some
     cases it’s also useful to provide commands which can change the
     value.  For example, the ‘magit-diff-refresh-popup’ can be used to
     change any of the arguments used to display the diff, without
     having to specify again which differences should be shown.
     ‘magit-diff-more-context’, ‘magit-diff-less-context’, and
     ‘magit-diff-default-context’ change just the ‘-U<N>’ argument.  In
     both case this is done by changing the value of this variable and
     then calling this ‘magit-refresh-function’.

File: magit.info,  Node: Confirmation and completion,  Next: Theming Faces,  Up: Conventions

10.4.1 Confirmation and completion
----------------------------------

Dangerous operations that may lead to data loss have to be confirmed by
default.  With a multi-section selection, this is done using questions
that can be answered with "yes" or "no".  When the region isn’t active,
or if it doesn’t constitute a valid section selection, then such
commands instead read a single item in the minibuffer.  When the value
of the current section is among the possible choices, then that is
presented as default choice.  To confirm the action on a single item,
the user has to answer ‘RET’ (instead of "yes"), and to abort, ‘C-g’
(instead of "no").  But alternatively the user may also select another
item, just like if the command had been invoked with no suitable section
at point at all.


File: magit.info,  Node: Theming Faces,  Prev: Confirmation and completion,  Up: Conventions

10.4.2 Theming Faces
--------------------

The default theme uses blue for local branches, green for remote
branches, and goldenrod (brownish yellow) for tags.  When creating a new
theme, you should probably follow that example.  If your theme already
uses other colors, then stick to that.

   In older releases these reference faces used to have a background
color and a box around them.  The basic default faces no longer do so,
to make Magit buffers much less noisy, and you should follow that
example at least with regards to boxes.  (Boxes were used in the past to
work around a conflict between the highlighting overlay and text
property backgrounds.  That’s no longer necessary because highlighting
no longer causes other background colors to disappear.)  Alternatively
you can keep the background color and/or box, but then have to take
special care to adjust ‘magit-branch-current’ accordingly.  By default
it looks mostly like ‘magit-branch-local’, but with a box (by default
the former is the only face that uses a box, exactly so that it sticks
out).  If the former also uses a box, then you have to make sure that it
differs in some other way from the latter.

   The most difficult faces to theme are those related to diffs,
headings, highlighting, and the region.  There are faces that fall into
all four groups - expect to spend some time getting this right.

   The ‘region’ face in the default theme, in both the light and dark
variants, as well as in many other themes, distributed with Emacs or by
third-parties, is very ugly.  It is common to use a background color
that really sticks out, which is ugly but if that were the only problem
then it would be acceptable.  Unfortunately many themes also set the
foreground color, which ensures that all text within the region is
readable.  Without doing that there might be cases where some foreground
color is too close to the region background color to still be readable.
But it also means that text within the region loses all syntax
highlighting.

   I consider the work that went into getting the ‘region’ face right to
be a good indicator for the general quality of a theme.  My
recommendation for the ‘region’ face is this: use a background color
slightly different from the background color of the ‘default’ face, and
do not set the foreground color at all.  So for a light theme you might
use a light (possibly tinted) gray as the background color of ‘default’
and a somewhat darker gray for the background of ‘region’.  That should
usually be enough to not collide with the foreground color of any other
face.  But if some other faces also set a light gray as background
color, then you should also make sure it doesn’t collide with those (in
some cases it might be acceptable though).

   Magit only uses the ‘region’ face when the region is "invalid" by its
own definition.  In a Magit buffer the region is used to either select
multiple sibling sections, so that commands which support it act on all
of these sections instead of just the current section, or to select
lines within a single hunk section.  In all other cases, the section is
considered invalid and Magit won’t act on it.  But such invalid sections
happen, either because the user has not moved point enough yet to make
it valid or because she wants to use a non-magit command to act on the
region, e.g.  ‘kill-region’.

   So using the regular ‘region’ face for invalid sections is a feature.
It tells the user that Magit won’t be able to act on it.  It’s
acceptable if that face looks a bit odd and even (but less so) if it
collides with the background colors of section headings and other things
that have a background color.

   Magit highlights the current section.  If a section has subsections,
then all of them are highlighted.  This is done using faces that have
"highlight" in their names.  For most sections,
‘magit-section-highlight’ is used for both the body and the heading.
Like the ‘region’ face, it should only set the background color to
something similar to that of ‘default’.  The highlight background color
must be different from both the ‘region’ background color and the
‘default’ background color.

   For diff related sections Magit uses various faces to highlight
different parts of the selected section(s).  Note that hunk headings,
unlike all other section headings, by default have a background color,
because it is useful to have very visible separators between hunks.
That face ‘magit-diff-hunk-heading’, should be different from both
‘magit-diff-hunk-heading-highlight’ and ‘magit-section-highlight’, as
well as from ‘magit-diff-context’ and ‘magit-diff-context-highlight’.
By default we do that by changing the foreground color.  Changing the
background color would lead to complications, and there are already
enough we cannot get around.  (Also note that it is generally a good
idea for section headings to always be bold, but only for sections that
have subsections).

   When there is a valid region selecting diff-related sibling sections,
i.e.  multiple files or hunks, then the bodies of all these sections use
the respective highlight faces, but additionally the headings instead
use one of the faces ‘magit-diff-file-heading-selection’ or
‘magit-diff-hunk-heading-selection’.  These faces have to be different
from the regular highlight variants to provide explicit visual
indication that the region is active.

   When theming diff related faces, start by setting the option
‘magit-diff-refine-hunk’ to ‘all’.  You might personally prefer to only
refine the current hunk or not use hunk refinement at all, but some of
the users of your theme want all hunks to be refined, so you have to
cater to that.

   (Also turn on ‘magit-diff-highlight-indentation’,
‘magit-diff-highlight-trailing’, and ‘magit-diff-paint-whitespace’; and
insert some whitespace errors into the code you use for testing.)

   For e.g.  "added lines" you have to adjust three faces:
‘magit-diff-added’, ‘magit-diff-added-highlight’, and
‘smerge-refined-added’.  Make sure that the latter works well with both
of the former, as well as ‘smerge-other’ and ‘diff-added’.  Then do the
same for the removed lines, context lines, lines added by us, and lines
added by them.  Also make sure the respective added, removed, and
context faces use approximately the same saturation for both the
highlighted and unhighlighted variants.  Also make sure the file and
diff headings work nicely with context lines (e.g.  make them look
different).  Line faces should set both the foreground and the
background color.  For example, for added lines use two different
greens.

   It’s best if the foreground color of both the highlighted and the
unhighlighted variants are the same, so you will need to have to find a
color that works well on the highlight and unhighlighted background, the
refine background, and the highlight context background.  When there is
an hunk internal region, then the added- and removed-lines background
color is used only within that region.  Outside the region the
highlighted context background color is used.  This makes it easier to
see what is being staged.  With an hunk internal region the hunk heading
is shown using ‘magit-diff-hunk-heading-selection’, and so are the thin
lines that are added around the lines that fall within the region.  The
background color of that has to be distinct enough from the various
other involved background colors.

   Nobody said this would be easy.  If your theme restricts itself to a
certain set of colors, then you should make an exception here.
Otherwise it would be impossible to make the diffs look good in each and
every variation.  Actually you might want to just stick to the default
definitions for these faces.  You have been warned.  Also please note
that if you do not get this right, this will in some cases look to users
like bugs in Magit - so please do it right or not at all.

File: magit.info,  Node: I am using an Emacs release older than 244,  Next: I am using a Git release older than 194,  Prev: I am having problems committing,  Up: FAQ

A.3 I am using an Emacs release older than 24.4
===============================================

At least version 24.4 is required.  There is no way around it.

   If you own the machine you work on, then consider updating to the
latest release provided by your distribution.  If it doesn’t feature a
recent enough release, then you will have to use a backport package or
build Emacs from source.

   Installing Emacs from source is quite simple.  See the instructions
at <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/INSTALL> and
<http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/INSTALL.REPO> to get an
idea of that this involves.  But when you perform the installation then
use the instructions for the release you are actually installing.

   Unfortunately these instructions do not cover the hardest part (which
is the hardest part exactly because it is not covered there): installing
the build time dependencies.

   For that you’ll need to perform a web search and find an appropriate
tutorial for your distribution.  If you think you should not have had to
do that yourself, then consider informing me about the resources that
helped you figure what to do for your specific setup, so that I can post
a link here.  That way those coming after you have it easier.

A.4 I am using a Git release older than 1.9.4
=============================================

At least version 1.9.4 is required.  There is no way around it.

   If you own the machine, then consider updating to the latest release
provided by your distribution.  If it doesn’t feature a recent enough
release, then you will have to use a backport package or build Git from
source.

   Installing Git from source is quite simple.  See the instructions at

this involves.  But when you perform the installation then use the

A.5 I am using MS Windows and cannot push with Magit
====================================================

It’s almost certain that Magit is only incidental to this issue.  It is
much more likely that this is a configuration issue, even if you can
push on the command line.

   Detailed setup instructions can be found at
<https://github.com/magit/magit/wiki/Pushing-with-Magit-from-Windows>.


File: magit.info,  Node: How to install the gitman info manual?,  Next: How can I show Git's output?,  Prev: I am using MS Windows and cannot push with Magit,  Up: FAQ

A.6 How to install the gitman info manual?
==========================================

Git’s manpages can be exported as an info manual called ‘gitman’.
Magit’s own info manual links to nodes in that manual instead of the
actual manpages because texinfo sadly doesn’t support linking to
manpages.

   Unfortunately many distributions do not install the ‘gitman’ manual
by default.  Some distributions may provide a separate package
containing the info manual.  Please let me know the name of that package
for your distribution, so that I can mention here.

   If the distribution you are using does not offer a package that
contains the ‘gitman’ manual, then you have to install it manually.
Clone Git’s own Git repository, checkout the tag corresponding to the
Git release you have installed, and follow the instructions in
‘INSTALL’.  The relevant make targets are ‘info’ and ‘install-info’.

   Alternatively you may add this advice to your ‘init.el’ file.

     (defadvice Info-follow-nearest-node (around gitman activate)
       "When encountering a cross reference to the `gitman' info
     manual, then instead of following that cross reference show
     the actual manpage using the function `man'."
       (let ((node (Info-get-token
                    (point) "\\*note[ \n\t]+"
                    "\\*note[ \n\t]+\\([^:]*\\):\\(:\\|[ \n\t]*(\\)?")))
         (if (and node (string-match "^(gitman)\\(.+\\)" node))
             (progn (require 'man)
                    (man (match-string 1 node)))
           ad-do-it)))

   Or if you are using MS Windows and ‘man’ is not available, use this
variation with used the Emacs Lisp implementation provided by the
‘woman’ package.

     (defadvice Info-follow-nearest-node (around gitman activate)
       "When encountering a cross reference to the `gitman' info
     manual, then instead of following that cross reference show
     the actual manpage using the function `woman'."
       (let ((node (Info-get-token
                    (point) "\\*note[ \n\t]+"
                    "\\*note[ \n\t]+\\([^:]*\\):\\(:\\|[ \n\t]*(\\)?")))
         (if (and node (string-match "^(gitman)\\(.+\\)" node))
             (progn (require 'woman)
                    (woman (match-string 1 node)))
           ad-do-it)))

   Did I mention that texinfo cross reference are just awful?  (This is
just one of many issues.)


File: magit.info,  Node: How can I show Git's output?,  Next: Expanding a file to show the diff causes it to disappear,  Prev: How to install the gitman info manual?,  Up: FAQ

A.7 How can I show Git’s output?
================================

To show the output of recently run git commands, press ‘$’ (or, if that
isn’t available, ‘M-x magit-process-buffer’).  This will show a buffer
containing a section per git invocation; as always press ‘TAB’ to expand
or collapse them.

   By default git’s output is only inserted into the process buffer if
it is run for side-effects.  When the output is consumed in some way
then also inserting it into the process buffer would be to expensive.
For debugging purposes it’s possible to do so anyway by setting
‘magit-git-debug’ to ‘t’.

A.8 Expanding a file to show the diff causes it to disappear
============================================================

This is probably caused by a change of a ‘diff.*’ Git variable.  You
probably set that variable for a reason, and should therefore only undo
that setting in Magit by customizing ‘magit-git-global-arguments’.


File: magit.info,  Node: Magit claims repository accessed using Tramp does not exist,  Next: Can Magit be used as ediff-version-control-package?,  Prev: Expanding a file to show the diff causes it to disappear,  Up: FAQ

A.9 Magit claims repository accessed using Tramp does not exist
===============================================================

"There is no Git repository in /ssh:host:/path/to/repository".

   Magit requires at least version ‘1.9.4’.  When connecting to a remote
machine using Tramp it requires that same version on that remote.

   By default Tramp searches for programs in the directories given by
the output of ‘getconf PATH’ on the remote host.  Therefore, if the
remote git version that you intend to use lives in a non-standard
location, you may need to alter ‘tramp-remote-path’.  Consult the Tramp
documentation on remote programs
<http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Remote-Programs.html>
for details.

   There are others reasons why Magit/Git might think that there is no
repository where there actually is one, but when this is being reported
then it’s usually the above.


File: magit.info,  Node: Can Magit be used as ediff-version-control-package?,  Next: How to show diffs for gpg-encrypted files?,  Prev: Magit claims repository accessed using Tramp does not exist,  Up: FAQ

A.10 Can Magit be used as ediff-version-control-package?
========================================================

No, it cannot.  For that to work the functions ‘ediff-magit-internal’
and ‘ediff-magit-merge-internal’ would have to be implemented, and they
are not.  These two functions are only used by the three commands
‘ediff-revision’, ‘ediff-merge-revisions-with-ancestor’, and
‘ediff-merge-revisions’.

   These commands only delegate the task of populating buffers with
certain revisions to the "internal" functions.  The equally important
task of determining which revisions are to be compared/merged is not
delegated.  Instead this is done without any support whatsoever, from
the version control package/system - meaning that the user has to enter
the revisions explicitly.  Instead of implementing
‘ediff-magit-internal’ we provide ‘magit-ediff-compare’, which handles
both tasks like it is 2005.

   The other commands ‘ediff-merge-revisions’ and
‘ediff-merge-revisions-with-ancestor’ are normally not what you want
when using a modern version control system like Git.  Instead of letting
the user resolve only those conflicts which Git could not resolve on its
own, they throw away all work done by Git and then expect the user to
manually merge all conflicts, including those that had already been
resolved.  That made sense back in the days when version control systems
couldn’t merge (or so I have been told), but not anymore.  Once in a
blue moon you might actually want to see all conflicts, in which case
you *can* use these commands, which then use ‘ediff-vc-merge-internal’.
So we don’t actually have to implement ‘ediff-magit-merge-internal’.
Instead we provide the more useful command ‘magit-ediff-resolve’ which
only shows yet-to-be resolved conflicts.

A.11 How to show diffs for gpg-encrypted files?
===============================================

Git supports showing diffs for encrypted files, but has to be told to do
so.  Since Magit just uses Git to get the diffs, configuring Git also
affects the diffs displayed inside Magit.

This is actually triggered by loading Tramp.  See
<https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=20015> for details.  You
can work around the problem by setting
‘tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options’.  Changing your DNS server (e.g.  to
Google’s ‘8.8.8.8’) may also be sufficient to work around the issue.
