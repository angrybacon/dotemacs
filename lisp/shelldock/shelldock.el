;;; Commentary:

;; Small framework to prevent your cache files from littering in your Emacs
;; directory.
;;
;; Other packages with similar intent already exist but I've been using my own
;; for so long -- and it does exactly what I want -- that there's no real point
;; in trying to force another code to do that (yet).

;;; Code:

(defgroup shelldock nil
  "Hide away your cache files."
  :group 'convenience)

(defcustom shelldock-directory (expand-file-name ".cache/" user-emacs-directory)
  "Directory where all cache files should be saved."
  :type 'directory)

;;;###autoload
(defun shelldock (file)
  "Return the absolute path of FILE under `shelldock-directory'."
  (let* ((directory (file-name-as-directory shelldock-directory))
         (path (convert-standard-filename (concat directory file))))
    (make-directory (file-name-directory path) t)
    path))

(with-eval-after-load 'request
  (setq-default request-storage-directory (shelldock "request/")))

(with-eval-after-load 'tramp
  (setq-default tramp-persistency-file-name (shelldock "tramp.eld")))

(with-eval-after-load 'url
  (setq-default url-configuration-directory (shelldock "url/")))

(provide 'shelldock)

;;; shelldock.el ends here
