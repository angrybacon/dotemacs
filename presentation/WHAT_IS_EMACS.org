* Who am I?

- I do TypeScript for a living at ManoMano
- I contribute to open-source projects
- Mostly I do that directly in Emacs

* What is Emacs?

** Name origin: /Editor MACroS/

** First Release in 1985

- Under the GNU project
- Written in /C/ and /Lisp/

** Number 1 feature is self-discoverability

- Everything is controllable from the interpreter
- Everything can be an interactive command
- Everything is self-documented

* What do I do with it

- I write version-controlled code
- I do (your) code reviews
- I do small scripts for my board games
- This very presentation

* What the .el

** Number 2 feature is customizability

- Un-themed Emacs is (very) ugly
- Everything is live, I can change /anything/ on the fly
- If I want /something/, I make /something/... or steal /something/

** My /dot/ Emacs

- 1645 commits, 4400 lines of code
- 71 forks, 335 stars
- An evergrowing todo list
